Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance you must keep moving.,Albert Einstein,,https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Cycling,6 June 2017
"It is by riding a bicycle that you learn the contours of a country best, since you have to sweat up the hills and can coast down them.... Thus you remember them as they actually are, while in a motorcar only a high hill impresses you, and you have no such accurate remembrance of country you have driven through as you gain by riding a bicycle.",Ernest Hemingway,,https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Cycling,6 June 2017
"Let me tell you what I think of bicycling. I think it has done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world. I stand and rejoice every time I see a woman ride by on a wheel. It gives a woman a feeling of freedom and self-reliance. It makes her feel as if she were independent. The moment she takes her seat she knows she can't get into harm unless she gets off her bicycle, and away she goes, the picture of free, untrammelled womanhood.",Susan B. Anthony,,https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Cycling,6 June 2017
