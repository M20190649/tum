  abstract = {Embedded computing and sensor systems are increasingly becoming an integral part of today's infrastructure. From jet engines to vending machines, our society relies on embedded computing and sensor systems to support numerous applications seamlessly and reliably. This is especially true with respect to autonomous systems such as unmanned aircraft, unmanned ground vehicles, robotics, medical operations, and industrial automation. However, given society's increasing reliance on embedded computing and sensor systems as well as the applications they support, this introduces a new form of vulnerability into this critical infrastructure that is only now beginning to be recognized as a significant threat with potentially serious consequences. This column presents the latest insights on the technical challenges and opportunities associated with the security of autonomous systems from an embedded computing and sensors perspective.},

  doi = {10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795942},
  abstract = {Companies developing and maintaining software-only products like web shops aim for establishing persistent links to their software running in the field. Monitoring data from real usage scenarios allows for a number of improvements in the software life-cycle, such as quick identification and solution of issues, and elicitation of requirements from previously unexpected usage. While the processes of continuous integration, continuous deployment, and continuous experimentation using sandboxing technologies are becoming well established in said software-only products, adopting similar practices for the automotive domain is more complex mainly due to real-time and safety constraints. In this paper, we systematically evaluate sandboxed software deployment in the context of a self-driving heavy vehicle that participated in the 2016 Grand Cooperative Driving Challenge (GCDC) in The Netherlands. We measured the system's scheduling precision after deploying applications in four different execution environments. Our results indicate that there is no significant difference in performance and overhead when sandboxed environments are used compared to natively deployed software. Thus, recent trends in software architecting, packaging, and maintenance using microservices encapsulated in sandboxes will help to realize similar software and system engineering for cyber-physical systems.},

  abstract = {Advanced driver assistance systems (ADASs) enhance transportation safety and mobility, and reduce impacts on the environment and economical costs, through decreasing driver errors. One of the main features of ADASs is cruise control system that maintains the driver's desired speed without intervention from the driver. Adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems adjust the vehicle's speed to maintain a safe following distance to the vehicle in front. Adding vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications (V2X) to ACC systems, result in cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) systems, where each vehicle has trajectory data of all other vehicles in the same lane. Although CACC systems offer advantages over ACC systems in increasing throughput and average speed, they are more vulnerable to cyber-security attacks. This is due to V2X communications that increase the attack surface from one vehicle to multiple vehicles. In this paper, we inject common types of attack on the application layer of connected vehicles to show their vulnerability in comparison to autonomous vehicles. We also proposed a decision support system that eliminates risk of inaccurate information. The microscopic work simulates a CACC system with a bi-objective PID controller and a fuzzy detector. A case study is illustrated in detail to verify the system functionality.},

  abstract = {The automobile industry has grown to become an integral part of our everyday life. As vehicles evolve, the primarily mechanical solutions for vehicle control are gradually replaced by electronics and software solutions forming in-vehicle computer networks. An emerging trend is to introduce wireless technology in the vehicle domain by attaching a wireless gateway to the in-vehicle network. By allowing wireless communication, real-time information exchange between vehicles and between infrastructure and vehicles become reality. This communication allows for road condition reporting, decision making, and remote diagnostics and firmware updates over-the-air. However, allowing external parties wireless access to the in-vehicle network creates a potential entry-point for cyber attacks. In this paper, we investigate the security issues of allowing external wireless communication. We use a defense-in-depth perspective and discuss security challenges for each of the prevention, detection, deflection, countermeasures, and recovery layers.},

  abstract = {Modern automobiles are no longer mere mechanical devices; they are pervasively monitored and controlled by dozens of digital computers coordinated via internal vehicular networks. While this transformation has driven major advancements in efficiency and safety, it has also introduced a range of new potential risks. In this paper we experimentally evaluate these issues on a modern automobile and demonstrate the fragility of the underlying system structure. We demonstrate that an attacker who is able to infiltrate virtually any Electronic Control Unit (ECU) can leverage this ability to completely circumvent a broad array of safety-critical systems. Over a range of experiments, both in the lab and in road tests, we demonstrate the ability to adversarially control a wide range of automotive functions and completely ignore driver inputdash including disabling the brakes, selectively braking individual wheels on demand, stopping the engine, and so on. We find that it is possible to bypass rudimentary network security protections within the car, such as maliciously bridging between our car's two internal subnets. We also present composite attacks that leverage individual weaknesses, including an attack that embeds malicious code in a car's telematics unit and that will completely erase any evidence of its presence after a crash. Looking forward, we discuss the complex challenges in addressing these vulnerabilities while considering the existing automotive ecosystem.},

  title = {Robust {{Physical}}-{{World Attacks}} on {{Deep Learning Models}}},
  abstract = {Although deep neural networks (DNNs) perform well in a variety of applications, they are vulnerable to adversarial examples resulting from small-magnitude perturbations added to the input data. Inputs modified in this way can be mislabeled as a target class in targeted attacks or as a random class different from the ground truth in untargeted attacks. However, recent studies have demonstrated that such adversarial examples have limited effectiveness in the physical world due to changing physical conditions--they either completely fail to cause misclassification or only work in restricted cases where a relatively complex image is perturbed and printed on paper. In this paper, we propose a general attack algorithm--Robust Physical Perturbations (RP2)-- that takes into account the numerous physical conditions and produces robust adversarial perturbations. Using a real-world example of road sign recognition, we show that adversarial examples generated using RP2 achieve high attack success rates in the physical world under a variety of conditions, including different viewpoints. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, there is currently no standardized way to evaluate physical adversarial perturbations. Therefore, we propose a two-stage evaluation methodology and tailor it to the road sign recognition use case. Our methodology captures a range of diverse physical conditions, including those encountered when images are captured from moving vehicles. We evaluate our physical attacks using this methodology and effectively fool two road sign classifiers. Using a perturbation in the shape of black and white stickers, we attack a real Stop sign, causing targeted misclassification in 100\% of the images obtained in controlled lab settings and above 84\% of the captured video frames obtained on a moving vehicle for one of the classifiers we attack.},

An effective security audit should not be a one-time event but rather an ongoing process. Security is a delicate balance between protection, availability and user acceptance. We start the security audit at the outside of the network and gradually work our way inward. We performed a vulnerability check on the exposed IP addresses and ports. Each of the vulnerabilities found was carefully assessed to see if it violated the security policies of the organization. An analysis of firewalls and various remote access methods of the organization were also evaluated. Using a wireless network sniffer, we found the footprints of the wireless LAN and some interesting results were obtained. Finally, some sensitive managerial issues and findings of an awareness survey of information security were presented.},

The present study investigated whether this distinction was justified for self-reported driver behaviour. Five hundred and twenty drivers completed a driver behaviour questionnaire (DBQ) which asked them to judge the frequency with which they committed various types of errors and violations when driving. Three fairly robust factors were identified: violations, dangerous errors, and relatively harmless lapses, respectively. Violations declined with age, errors did not. Men of all ages reported more violations than women. Women, however, were significantly more prone to harmless lapses (or more honest) than men. These findings were consistent with the view that errors and violations are indeed mediated by different psychological mechanisms. Violations require explanation in terms of social and motivational factors, whereas errors (slips, lapses, and mistakes) may be accounted for by reference to the information-processing characteristics of the individual.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses four topics relating to safety culture, three theoretical and one practical. The first considers why it is that an unsafe culture is more likely to be involved in the causation of organizational rather than individual accidents. It is the pervasive nature of culture that makes it uniquely suitable for creating and sustaining the co-linear gaps in defences-in-depth through which an accident trajectory has to pass. The second topic relates to pathological adaptations, and discusses two examples: the Royal Navy of the mid-nineteenth century and the Chernobyl reactor complex. The third issue deals with recurrent accident patterns and considers the role of cultural drivers in creating typical accidents. The final topic is concerned with the practical question of whether a safety culture can be engineered. It is argued that a safe culture is an informed culture and this, in turn, depends upon creating an effective reporting culture that is underpinned by a just culture in which the line between acceptable and unacceptable behaviour is clearly drawn and understood.},

  abstract = {The past two decades have seen a significant number of large-scale disasters in a wide range of hazardous, well-defended technologies. Despite their differences, the root causes of these accidents have been traced to latent failures and organizational errors arising in the upper echelons of the system in question. A model of the aetiology of these organizational accidents is outlined. The model describes two interrelated causal sequences: (a) an active failure pathway that originates in top-level decisions and proceeds via error-producing and violation-promoting conditions in the various workplaces to unsafe acts committed by those at the immediate human-system interface and (b) a latent failure pathway that runs directly from the organizational processes to deficiencies in the system's defences. The paper goes on to identify two sets of dependencies associated with latent failures and violations. Organizational errors increase the likelihood of operator error through the active failure pathway and, at the same time, enhance the possibility of adverse outcomes through defensive weaknesses. Violations have a narrower range of consequences. Non-compliance with safe operating procedures increases the likelihood of error by taking perpetrators into regions of operation in which neither the physical regime nor the hazards are well understood. Violations, by definition, also take perpetrators `closer to the edge,' and thus increase the chance that subsequent errors will have damaging outcomes. The paper concludes by indicating two ways in which the model has been applied in industrial settings: (a) through the development of proactive measures for diagnosing and remedying organizational processes known to be implicated in accident causation, and (b) an accident investigation technique that guides investigators and analysts to the organizational root causes of past accidents.},

  title = {Sampling-Based {{Algorithms}} for {{Optimal Motion Planning}}},
  abstract = {During the last decade, sampling-based path planning algorithms, such as Probabilistic RoadMaps (PRM) and Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT), have been shown to work well in practice and possess theoretical guarantees such as probabilistic completeness. However, little effort has been devoted to the formal analysis of the quality of the solution returned by such algorithms, e.g., as a function of the number of samples. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap, by rigorously analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the cost of the solution returned by stochastic sampling-based algorithms as the number of samples increases. A number of negative results are provided, characterizing existing algorithms, e.g., showing that, under mild technical conditions, the cost of the solution returned by broadly used sampling-based algorithms converges almost surely to a non-optimal value. The main contribution of the paper is the introduction of new algorithms, namely, PRM* and RRT*, which are provably asymptotically optimal, i.e., such that the cost of the returned solution converges almost surely to the optimum. Moreover, it is shown that the computational complexity of the new algorithms is within a constant factor of that of their probabilistically complete (but not asymptotically optimal) counterparts. The analysis in this paper hinges on novel connections between stochastic sampling-based path planning algorithms and the theory of random geometric graphs.},

Safety-critical tasks that must be executed by a self-driving vehicle include planning of motions through a dynamic environment shared with other vehicles and pedestrians, and their robust executions via feedback control. The objective of this paper is to survey the current state of the art on planning and control algorithms with particular regard to the urban setting. A selection of proposed techniques is reviewed along with a discussion of their effectiveness. The surveyed approaches differ in the vehicle mobility model used, in assumptions on the structure of the environment, and in computational requirements. The side-by-side comparison presented in this survey helps to gain insight into the strengths and limitations of the reviewed approaches and assists with system level design choices.},

Other proprietary Cybersecurity development processes and standards may have been established to support a specific manufacturer's development processes, and may not be comprehensively represented in this document, however, information contained in this document may help refine existing in-house processes, methods, etc. This recommended practice establishes a set of high-level guiding principles for Cybersecurity as it relates to cyber-physical vehicle systems. This includes: \textbullet{}	Defining a complete lifecycle process framework that can be tailored and utilized within each organization's development processes to incorporate Cybersecurity into cyber-physical vehicle systems from concept phase through production, operation, service, and decommissioning. \textbullet{}	Providing information on some common existing tools and methods used when designing, verifying and validating cyber-physical vehicle systems. \textbullet{}	Providing basic guiding principles on Cybersecurity for vehicle systems. \textbullet{}	Providing the foundation for further standards development activities in vehicle Cybersecurity. The appendices provide additional information to be aware of and may be used in helping improve Cybersecurity of feature designs. Much of the information identified in the appendices is available but some experts may not be aware of all of the available information. Therefore, the appendices provide an overview of some of this information to provide further guidance on building Cybersecurity into cyber-physical vehicle systems. The objective of the overviews is to encourage research to help improve designs and identify methods and tools for applying a company's internal Cybersecurity process.

The result is a robust and flexible robot control system. The system has been used to control a mobile robot wandering around unconstrained laboratory areas and computer machine rooms. Eventually it is intended to control a robot that wanders the office areas of our laboratory, building maps of its surroundings using an onboard arm to perform simple tasks.},

  abstract = {The Controller Area Network (CAN) is established as the main communication channel inside vehicles. CAN relies on frame broadcast to share data between different microcontrollers managing critical or comfort functions such as cruise control or air conditioning. CAN is distinguished by its simplicity, its real-time application compatibility and its low deployment cost. However, CAN major drawback is its lack of security support. That is, CAN fails to provide protections against attacks such as intrusion, denial of service or impersonation. We propose in this work a simple intrusion detection method for CAN. Our main idea is to make each microcontroller monitor the CAN bus to detect malicious frames.},

The parameters building the DNN structure are trained with probability-based feature vectors that are extracted from the in-vehicular network packets. For a given packet, the DNN provides the probability of each class discriminating normal and attack packets, and, thus the sensor can identify any malicious attack to the vehicle. As compared to the traditional artificial neural network applied to the IDS, the proposed technique adopts recent advances in deep learning studies such as initializing the parameters through the unsupervised pre-training of deep belief networks (DBN), therefore improving the detection accuracy. It is demonstrated with experimental results that the proposed technique can provide a real-time response to the attack with a significantly improved detection ratio in controller area network (CAN) bus.},

  abstract = {Controller Area Network (CAN) bus in the vehicles is a de facto standard for serial communication to provide an efficient, reliable and economical link between Electronic Control Units (ECU). However, CAN bus does not have enough security features to protect itself from inside or outside attacks. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is one of the best ways to enhance the vehicle security level. Unlike the traditional IDS for network security, IDS for vehicle requires light-weight detection algorithm because of the limitations of the computing power of electronic devices reside in cars. In this paper, we propose a light-weight intrusion detection algorithm for in-vehicle network based on the analysis of time intervals of CAN messages. We captured CAN messages from the cars made by a famous manufacturer and performed three kinds of message injection attacks. As a result, we find the time interval is a meaningful feature to detect attacks in the CAN traffic. Also, our intrusion detection system detects all of message injection attacks without making false positive errors.},

  abstract = {With technology and computers becoming more and more sophisticated and readily available, cars have followed suit by integrating more and more microcontrollers to handle tasks ranging from controlling the radio to the brakes and steering. Handling all of these separate processors is a communication system and protocol known as Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. While the CAN bus is a robust system for sending messages, allowing control of the car through the CAN bus presents an opportunity for an outside party to interfere with the operations of a car. Any number of different methods could be used to hack the bus and take control of a car, including hacking into the bus remotely, plugging a small device into the on-board diagnostics port to the CAN bus, or swapping an existing node on the CAN bus for one that has been tampered with. This presents obvious safety risks, so to guard against this possibility, this paper will present an algorithm designed to recognize nodes based on the noise content of their signal so that any messages coming from an improper source can be flagged as suspicious.

The algorithm makes use of MATLAB and Python to perform various transformations on the data and calculate features of the noise in a signal. These features are then passed through a statistical analysis which provides each one a score for how much useful information it contains. The best performing features are run through both a multilayer perceptron neural network and a support vector machine, and the results are compared. Each algorithm gives strong prediction performance, with prediction accuracies of 99.9\% and 99.8\% for the neural network and support vector machine, respectively.},

A particularly insidious threat to vehicles security is that an attacker may exploit the vulnerabilities of in-vehicle communication network to attack vehicles, such as spoofing CAN bus messages. In this paper, we are thus motivated to propose a solution for achieving authenticated CAN communications, towards ameliorating the threats faced by the in-vehicle communication network. Strictly aiming for practicality and acceptance by the industry, our solution has two salient features: (1) it relies on the industry-wide recognized in-vehicle communication architecture, without requiring addition of any extra hardware; (2) it makes use of standardized cryptographic techniques, without invoking any proprietary cryptographic primitives and mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Major accidents are rare events due to the many barriers, safeguards and defences developed by modern technologies. But they continue to happen with saddening regularity and their human and financial consequences are all too often unacceptably catastrophic. One of the greatest challenges we face is to develop more effective ways of both understanding and limiting their occurrence. This lucid book presents a set of common principles to further our knowledge of the causes of major accidents in a wide variety of high-technology systems. It also describes tools and techniques for managing the risks of such organizational accidents that go beyond those currently available to system managers and safety professionals. James Reason deals comprehensively with the prevention of major accidents arising from human and organizational causes. He argues that the same general principles and management techniques are appropriate for many different domains. These include banks and insurance companies just as much as nuclear power plants, oil exploration and production companies, chemical process installations and air, sea and rail transport. Its unique combination of principles and practicalities make this seminal book essential reading for all whose daily business is to manage, audit and regulate hazardous technologies of all kinds. It is relevant to those concerned with understanding and controlling human and organizational factors and will also interest academic readers and those working in industrial and government agencies.},

  abstract = {We present a system for extracting lane marker information from image data in a form suitable for use in the automated steering of moving vehicles. The algorithm was designed with speed and simplicity in mind. It assumes a flat, dark roadway with light colored lane markers, either solid or dashed, painted on it. The algorithm is based on extracting statistically significant ‘bright' regions from the image plane and fitting functions to those identified points which are consistent with the qualitative properties of roadway lanes and ground to image plane geometric relationships. It estimates a virtual lane centerline using left and right lane markers if both are available, otherwise it uses whichever lane marker is visible and a rough estimate of the lane width. The system has been tested in various autonomous vehicle control research projects, culminating in its demonstration on Ohio State University's automated vehicles at the 1997 AHS Technical Feasibility Demonstration in San Diego},

  abstract = {The ongoing development autonomous vehicles and adaptive vehicle dynamics present in many modern vehicles has generated a need for road environment classification - i.e., the ability to determine the nature of the current road or terrain environment from an onboard vehicle sensor. In this paper, we investigate the use of a low-cost camera vision solution capable of urban, rural, or off-road classification based on the analysis of color and texture features extracted from a driver's perspective camera view. A feature set based on color and texture distributions is extracted from multiple regions of interest in this forward-facing camera view and combined with a trained classifier approach to resolve two road-type classification problems of varying difficulty - off-road, on-road environment determination and the additional multiclass road environment problem of off-road, urban, major/trunk road and multilane motorway/carriageway. Two illustrative classification approaches are investigated, and the results are reported over a series of real environment data. An optimal performance of 90\% correct classification is achieved for the off-road, on-road problem at a near real-time classification rate of 1 Hz.},

We have structured our investigation by categorizing the research into the following five categories: problems in the in-vehicle network, architectural security features, intrusion detection systems, honeypots, and threats and attacks. We conclude that even though quite some effort has already been expended in the area, most of it has been directed towards problem definition and not so much towards security solutions. We also highlight a few areas that we believe are of immediate concern.},

Within the scope of this development, vehicular attack detection is one concept which gains an increased attention, because of its reactive nature that allows to respond to threats during runtime. In this paper we explore the applicability of entropy-based attack detection for in-vehicle networks. We illustrate the crucial aspects for an adaptation of such an approach to the automotive domain. Moreover, we show first exemplary results by applying the approach to measurements derived from a standard vehicle's CAN-Body network.},

To allow this, the previously isolated in-vehicle network must be connected to an external network, and can thus be exposed to a whole new range of threats known as cyber attacks. In this paper we explore the applicability of a specification-based approach to detect cyber attacks within the in-vehicle network. We derive information to create security specifications for communication and ECU behavior from the CANopen draft standard 3.01 communication protocol and object directory sections. We also provide a set of example specifications, propose a suitable location for the attack detector, and evaluate the detection using a set of attack actions.},

First, the effectiveness of the monotone output property in a single-input fuzzy assessment model is demonstrated with a proposed fuzzy occurrence model. Then, the usefulness of the two properties to a multi-input fuzzy assessment model, i.e., the Bowles fuzzy Risk Priority Number (RPN) model, is assessed. The experimental results indicate that both the fuzzy occurrence model and Bowles fuzzy RPN model are able to fulfill the monotone output property, with the derived conditions (in Part I) satisfied. In addition, the proposed rule refinement technique is able to improve the output resolution property of the Bowles fuzzy RPN model.},

Not only can compliance with a set of rules having little impact on the number of faults be considered wasted effort, but it can actually result in an increase in faults, as any modification has a non-zero probability of introducing a fault or triggering a previously concealed one. Therefore, it is important to build a body of empirical knowledge, helping us understand which rules are worthwhile enforcing, and which ones should be ignored in the context of fault reduction. In this paper, we describe two approaches to quantify the relation between rule violations and actual faults, and present empirical data on this relation for the MISRA C 2004 standard on an industrial case study.},

  abstract = {Vehicle automation has been one of the fundamental applications within the field of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) since the start of ITS research in the mid-1980s. For most of this time, it has been generally viewed as a futuristic concept that is not close to being ready for deployment. However, recent development of ``self-driving'' cars and the announcement by car manufacturers of their deployment by 2020 show that this is becoming a reality. The ITS industry has already been focusing much of its attention on the concepts of ``connected vehicles'' (United States) or ``cooperative ITS'' (Europe). These concepts are based on communication of data among vehicles (V2V) and/or between vehicles and the infrastructure (V2I/I2V) to provide the information needed to implement ITS applications. The separate threads of automated vehicles and cooperative ITS have not yet been thoroughly woven together, but this will be a necessary step in the near future because the cooperative exchange of data will provide vital inputs to improve the performance and safety of the automation systems. Thus, it is important to start thinking about the cybersecurity implications of cooperative automated vehicle systems. In this paper, we investigate the potential cyberattacks specific to automated vehicles, with their special needs and vulnerabilities. We analyze the threats on autonomous automated vehicles and cooperative automated vehicles. This analysis shows the need for considerably more redundancy than many have been expecting. We also raise awareness to generate discussion about these threats at this early stage in the development of vehicle automation systems.},

There are several benefits from a model-based approach. Firstly, the description of the target system, its context and all security relevant features required for risk analysis, can be improved by applying state-of-the-art modelling technology. Secondly, it provides a rich set of graphical descriptions that address properties of the target system as well as their context (including the behaviour of humans), which improves communication and interaction between stakeholders involved in a risk analysis and also facilitates the formalization of threats and more precise documentation of risk analysis results and the assumptions. Finally, tighter integration of risk management in the system development process may considerably reduce the development costs. In this paper we place the emphasis on the proposed guidelines and recommendations for model-based risk management, which will be evaluated through trials in the e-commerce and telemedicine areas. Since CORAS is an ongoing project, the research described here is work in progress.},

  abstract = {Abstract: The CORAS project develops a practical framework for model-based risk management of security critical systems by exploiting the synthesis of risk analysis methods with semiformal specification methods, supported by an adaptable tool-integration platform. The framework is also accompanied by the CORAS process, which is a systems development process based on the integration of RUP and a standardised security risk management process, and it is supported by an XML-based tool-integration platform. The CORAS framework and process are being validated in extensive user trials in the areas of e-commerce and telemedicine. This paper presents an overview of the CORAS framework, emphasising on the modelling approach followed in the first of the user trials (concerning the authentication mechanism of an ecommerce platform) and it provides some examples of the risk analyses employed in this context.},

State-of-the-art automotive architectures are highly heterogeneous and complex systems that rely on distributed functions based on electronics and software. As cars are getting more connected with their environment, the vulnerability to attacks is rapidly growing. Examples for such wireless communication are keyless entry systems, WiFi, or Bluetooth. Despite this increasing vulnerability, the design of automotive architectures is still mainly driven by safety and cost issues rather than security. In this paper, we present potential threats and vulnerabilities, and outline upcoming security challenges in automotive architectures. In particular, we discuss the challenges arising in electric vehicles, like the vulnerability to attacks involving tampering with the battery safety. Finally, we discuss future automotive architectures based on Ethernet/IP and how formal verification methods might be used to increase their security.},

  title = {A {{Security Analysis}} of an {{In Vehicle Infotainment}} and {{App Platform}}},
  abstract = {There is an increasing trend in the automotive industry towards integrating trusted third-party apps with In-Vehicle-Infotainment systems (IVI) via smartphones. This integration is typically facilitated by a pair of apps, one that executes on the smartphone and the other executes on the IVI which is connected to the Vehicle's Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. Throughout the evolution of these IVI and App platforms, there has been little public analysis of the security of these protocols and the frameworks that implement these apps on the IVI. This raises the question: to what extent are these apps, protocols and underlining IVI implementations vulnerable to an attacker who might gain control of a driver's smartphone? In this paper, we focus on gaining insights into this question by performing a comprehensive security analysis on an IVI system that is included in at least one 2015 model vehicle from a major automotive manufacturer. This IVI system included vestigial support for the MirrorLink protocol which is intentionally disabled but can be enabled by updating a single configuration value after applying a publicly available firmware update that is securely signed by the manufacturer. Based on our analysis, we document and demonstrate insecurities in the MirrorLink protocol and IVI implementation that could potentially enable an attacker with control of a driver's smartphone to send malicious messages on the vehicle's internal network.},

  abstract = {Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) have the potential to transform the way people travel through the creation of a safe interoperable wireless communications network that includes cars, buses, traffic signals, cell phones, and other devices. However, VANETs are vulnerable to security threats due to increasing reliance on communication, computing, and control technologies. The unique security and privacy challenges posed by VANETs include integrity (data trust), confidentiality, nonrepudiation, access control, real-time operational constraints/demands, availability, and privacy protection. The trustworthiness of VANETs could be improved by addressing holistically both data trust, which is defined as the assessment of whether or not and to what extent the reported traffic data are trustworthy, and node trust, which is defined as how trustworthy the nodes in VANETs are. In this paper, an attack-resistant trust management scheme (ART) is proposed for VANETs that is able to detect and cope with malicious attacks and also evaluate the trustworthiness of both data and mobile nodes in VANETs. Specially, data trust is evaluated based on the data sensed and collected from multiple vehicles; node trust is assessed in two dimensions, i.e., functional trust and recommendation trust, which indicate how likely a node can fulfill its functionality and how trustworthy the recommendations from a node for other nodes will be, respectively. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed ART scheme is validated through extensive experiments. The proposed trust management theme is applicable to a wide range of VANET applications to improve traffic safety, mobility, and environmental protection with enhanced trustworthiness.},

Based on a dynamic model characterizing the time evolution of the state of an organization, the organization's risk is defined as its maximum possible expected loss, and the risk assessment problem is modeled as a constrained optimization problem. The influence of different factors on an organization's risk is uncovered through theoretical analysis. Based on extensive experiments, we speculate that the attack strategy obtained by applying the hill-climbing method to the proposed optimization problem, which we call the HC strategy, always leads to the maximum possible expected loss. We then present a set of five heuristic attack strategies and, through comparative experiments, show that the HC strategy causes a higher risk than all these heuristic strategies do, which supports our conjecture. Finally, the impact of two factors on the attacker's HC cost profit is determined through computer simulations. These findings help understand the risk of APTs in a quantitative manner.},

To address this need, we define a novel risk assessment methodology specific to IT systems. Our model is quantitative, both asset and vulnerability centric and defines low and high level risk metrics. High level risk metrics are defined in two general categories; base and attack graph-based. In our paper, we provide a detailed explanation of formulations in each category and make our implemented software publicly available for those who are interested in applying the proposed methodology to their IT systems.},

  title = {The {{Economic}} and {{Societal Impact}} of {{Motor Vehicle Crashes}}, 2010 ({{Revised}})},
  abstract = {In 2010, there were 32,999 people killed, 3.9 million were injured, and 24 million vehicles were damaged in motor vehicle crashes in the United States. The economic costs of these crashes totaled \$242 billion. Included in these losses are lost productivity, medical costs, legal and court costs, emergency service costs (EMS), insurance administration costs, congestion costs, property damage, and workplace losses. The \$242 billion cost of motor vehicle crashes represents the equivalent of nearly \$784 for each of the 308.7 million people living in the United States, and 1.6 percent of the \$14.96 trillion real U.S. Gross Domestic Product for 2010. These figures include both police-reported and unreported crashes. When quality of life valuations are considered, the total value of societal harm from motor vehicle crashes in 2010 was \$836 billion. Lost market and household productivity accounted for \$77 billion of the total \$242 billion economic costs, while property damage accounted for \$76 billion. Medical expenses totaled \$23 billion. Congestion caused by crashes, including travel delay, excess fuel consumption, greenhouse gases and criteria pollutants accounted for \$28 billion. Each fatality resulted in an average discounted lifetime cost of \$1.4 million. Public revenues paid for roughly 7 percent of all motor vehicle crash costs, costing tax payers \$18 billion in 2010, the equivalent of over \$156 in added taxes for every household in the United States. Alcohol involved crashes accounted for \$52 billion or 22 percent of all economic costs, and 84 percent of these costs occurred in crashes where a driver or non-occupant had a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of .08 grams per deciliter or greater. Alcohol was the cause of the crash in roughly 82 percent of these cases, causing \$43 billion in costs. Crashes in which alcohol levels are BAC of .08 or higher are responsible for over 90 percent of the economic costs and societal harm that occurs in crashes attributable to alcohol use. Crashes in which police indicate that at least one driver was exceeding the legal speed limit or driving too fast for conditions cost \$52 billion in 2010. Seat belt use prevented 12,500 fatalities, 308,000 serious injuries, and \$50 billion in injury related costs in 2010, but the failure of a substantial portion of the driving population to buckle up caused 3,350 unnecessary fatalities, 54,300 serious injuries, and cost society \$10 billion in easily preventable injury related costs. Crashes in which at least one driver was identified as being distracted cost \$40 billion in 2010. The report also includes data on the costs associated with motorcycle crashes, failure to wear motorcycle helmets, pedestrian crash, bicyclist crashes, and numerous different roadway designation crashes.},

  abstract = {A ground shaking expos on the failure of popular cyber risk management methods  How to Measure Anything in Cybersecurity Risk exposes the shortcomings of current risk management practices, and offers a series of improvement techniques that help you fill the holes and ramp up security. In his bestselling book How to Measure Anything, author Douglas W. Hubbard opened the business worlds eyes to the critical need for better measurement. This book expands upon that premise and draws from The Failure of Risk Management to sound the alarm in the cybersecurity realm. Some of the fields premier risk management approaches actually create more risk than they mitigate, and questionable methods have been duplicated across industries and embedded in the products accepted as gospel. This book sheds light on these blatant risks, and provides alternate techniques that can help improve your current situation. Youll also learn which approaches are too risky to save, and are actually more damaging than a total lack of any security.  Dangerous risk management methods abound; there is no industry more critically in need of solutions than cybersecurity. This book provides solutions where they exist, and advises when to change tracks entirely.    Discover the shortcomings of cybersecuritys best practices  Learn which risk management approaches actually create risk  Improve your current practices with practical alterations  Learn which methods are beyond saving, and worse than doing nothing    Insightful and enlightening, this book will inspire a closer examination of your companys own risk management practices in the context of cybersecurity. The end goal is airtight data protection, so finding cracks in the vault is a positive thingas long as you get there before the bad guys do. How to Measure Anything in Cybersecurity Risk is your guide to more robust protection through better quantitative processes, approaches, and techniques.},

Specifically we analyze the Firmware Over The Air (FOTA) technology and its applicability to the automotive industry.Software update in the telecom industry has gone a great deal forward in providing an efficient FOTA solution. Today, all tier I mobile operators as well as device manufacturers are either providing a commercial FOTA service, or using FOTA in deployment phases. Some of them have already performed millions of firmware update transactions over the air, reducing costs, avoiding recalls and increasing customer satisfaction.Software in the automotive industry is growing quickly to become a significant part of the vehicle BOM. This growth and the exceptionally high warranty/recall cost could suggest a demand for FOTA. FOTA technology however, is currently not applied in the automotive industry; however, it is being evaluated by some industry players. Using FOTA in commercial vehicles may have additional benefits, since sometimes it is difficult to bring the vehicle to the dealer and the downtime cost is usually higher.This paper describes the existing update process, where a tethered connection is used to re-flash embedded device software, and the alternative FOTA technology. It analyzes several use cases and provides the significant benefits as well as the expected challenges which this new technology offers},

  abstract = {The substantial increase of electronic systems and processors in vehicles is increasing the already remarkable amount of software code, generating thousands of software-related recalls according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), leading to frequent customer updates. Current software updating methods are inconvenient for customers and dealers alike, requiring a significant amount of time and expensive hardware to implement. With Wi-Fi technology and embedded modems entering vehicles, several OEMs have already taken an innovative approach with Over-The-Air (OTA) technology. OTA updating has shown to be a proven method in the telecom industry with tens of millions of phones equipped with OTA capabilities and millions of successful OTA updates performed each year, contributing to a reliable and efficient method of updating. This paper analyzes the different ways OTA is currently being used to successfully achieve in-vehicle software updates. This paper also presents the results of a questionnaire conducted to assess the familiarity and acceptance of software update technologies. This paper concludes with an analysis of the questionnaire results and the authors' preferred implementation method of OTA based on the research.},

  abstract = {Control mechanisms established on the boundary of an information system are an important preliminary step to minimising losses from security breaches. The primary function of such controls is to restrict the use of information systems and resources to authorized users. Password-based systems remain the predominant method of user authentication despite the many sophisticated and viable security alternatives that have emerged from research and development. However, the literature shows that passwords are often compromised through the poor security and management practices of users. This paper examines user password composition and security practices for email accounts. The results of a survey that examines user practice in creating and using passwords are reported. The results show that many users know about the risks of hackers, viruses and so on and take preliminary steps to combat them such as having passwords longer than eight characters. However, this appears to be as far as many users are willing to accede to the probability that their information and computing resources can be compromised. This paper makes some recommendations for the education of users in creating and maintaining their passwords. The responsibility for these educational programs can be shared between governments, organisations, educational institutions at all levels, and software vendors.},

  abstract = {Known vulnerabilities which have been discovered but not patched represents a security risk which can lead to considerable financial damage or loss of reputation. They include vulnerabilities that have either no patches available or for which patches are applied after some delay. Exploitation is even possible before public disclosure of a vulnerability. This paper formally defines risk measures and examines possible approaches for assessing risk using actual data. We explore the use of CVSS vulnerability metrics which are publically available and are being used for ranking vulnerabilities. Then, a general stochastic risk evaluation approach is proposed which considers the vulnerability lifecycle starting with discovery. A conditional risk measure and assessment approach is also presented when only known vulnerabilities are considered. The proposed approach bridges formal risk theory with industrial approaches currently being used, allowing IT risk assessment in an organization, and a comparison of potential alternatives for optimizing remediation. These actual data driven methods will assist managers with software selection and patch application decisions in quantitative manner.},

There is a wide gulf between some observed automotive practices and established principles for safety critical system engineering. While some companies strive to do better, at least some car makers in the 2002-2010 era took a test-centric approach to safety that discounted nonreproducible and ``unrealistic'' faults, instead blaming driver error for mishaps. Regulators still follow policies from the pre-software safety assurance era. Eight general areas of contrast between accepted safety principles and observed automotive safety practices are identified. While the advent of ISO 26262 promises some progress, deployment of highly autonomous vehicles in a nonregulatory environment threatens to undermine safety engineering rigor.},
