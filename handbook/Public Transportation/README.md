### Right-of-Way

* [rail-bus differences: premise or conclusion?](http://humantransit.org/2011/03/rail-bus-differences-contd.html) [humantransit.org]
* A: Dedicated ways and intersections e.g. LACMTA Red Line
* B: Dedicated ways and shared intersections e.g. LACMTA Expo Line
  * possibility for intersection prioritization
* C: Shared ways and intersetions e.g. Buses

Right-of-Way Class | A | B | C
--- | --- | --- | ---
Investment Cost | high | medium | low
Operating Cost (per passenger) | low | medium | high
Speed | high | medium | low (slower than private cars)
Travel Time Reliability | high | medium | low
Capacity | high | medium | low
Vehicle Control | driver or automated | driver | driver
Guidance/Operation | interlock systems | interlock systems or by sight | by sight
Typical Vehicles | heavy rail | light rail, BRT | bus, tram
Line Capacity | up to 80,000 people/hour | up to 24,000 people/hour | up to 6,000 people/hour
Distance Between Stops (Accessibility) | low | medium | high
Network Density | low | medium | high
Stations | identifiable and informative | identifiable and informative | simple
Fare Collection | off-vehicle | off-vehicle | off-vehicle or on-vehicle
Boarding | quick, many doors | quick, many doors | could be slow
Network Map | simple | simple | complex, no map

### Vehicle Guidance

* Track / Guideway
  * allows for longer vehicles (higher capacity), less land use, better for tunnels, safety/automation possible
  * higher cost, higher stop spacing, less flexibility
* Driver Steered

### Propulsion

* Dinosaurs: Diesel, CNG, LNG
* Electric
  * higher acceleration, regenerative braking, no local pollution
  * higher investment cost, less reliable
* Hybrid

### Control

* Driver
* Automatic Train Operation
  * lowest headways, higher cost
  * w/ Driver
  * w/o Driver
    * lower cost

### Line Length

* Long: more direct trips, more efficient (less down time)
* Short: less delay propagation, difficult run cutting

### Interconnections

* Integrated
  * more direct trips/options, can schedule to match passenger demand, rerouting possible
  * more complex
  * common for bus networks
* Independent
  * greater overall capacity, less delay propegation, less complex
  * common for large networks in big cities

### Lines

* Radial
  * one terminal in city, one in suburbs
  * service follows demand direction, unbalanced demand
  * decreasing passenger volume outward from city
    * can run short lines from city
    * can branch
  * poor connectivity, terminals in city = poor use of space
  * w/ Loop
  * [Der MVV Netzplan - Eine Zeitreise von 1972 bis heute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0OGqjPS47E) [www.youtube.com]
* Diametrical
  * radial, but through city
  * balance demand on both sides, unbalanced demand city to suburb
  * better connectivity than radial, better use of space
  * delay propegation
  * L-shape = better connectivity, more direct trips
  * U-shape: balance demand between lines
* Tangential
  * typically low demand
* Circle
  * great for connectivity, suburb to suburb
  * vulnerable to delay propegation, headway must be integer fraction of the cycle time
    * open the circle
    * go slower than maximum possible -> speed up when delayed
    * stop at station w/ most transfers, fewest through passengers
  * Loop e.g. Singapore LRT
* Trunk
  * solves demand problem
  * rail2rail: requires coordination of schedules, infrastructure, better passenger experience
  * w/ Branches
    * direct, longer lines
  * rail2road: cheaper/easier
  * w/ Feeder
    * no delay propagation, can use different modes

### Networks

* Radial
  * service follows demand direction, unbalanced demand, high passenger value
  * few transfers (not possible)
* Radial/Cicumfrential
  * suburb2suburb, better connectivity
* Grid
  * good connectivity, lots of transfers
  * useful for all trip types
* Ubiquitous
  * many direct trips, lots of connectivity
  * useful for all trip types
* Irregular
  * service follows geography

### Integration (Transfers)

* No Transfers: Commuter or Highly Integrated
* Transfers: High Capacity Independent Lines
  * Hierarchical Structure: Functions: keep seperate
    * Collection/distribution - accessible, e.g. bus
    * Long-distance transport - fast, e.g. rail
  * perceived travel time with transfers must be less than perceived travel time w/ direct service
* Requirements
  * Network Design / Transfer Stations
    * e.g. Timed-transfer Stations
  * Schedule Coordination
    * uniform headway - easy to remember, balanced passenger loads -> less bunching
    * timed transfers ((Integrated) Synchronized Timetable): arrive together, wait a bit, depart together
      * when vehicles from two differnt lines have matching frequencies (typically 1 to 12 trains/hour) and meet each other across a platform at a certain station within 30 seconds to 5 minutes of each other. ticket/fare integation too.
      * Advantages: high geographical network coverage, reduced travel times due to optimized connections, simpler timetable, improved punctuality, continuous operation, reduction of empty trips
      * Disadvantages: high long-term investments in infrastructure, infrastructure is not used to capacity, high peak traffic at nodes, increase in travel time for some trips, requires prioritization of people over freight
    * short2short: no problem
    * long2short: no problem
    * short2long: publish timetable
    * long2long: same headway: timed transfer or only-one way transfers (one arrives and departs before the other), different headway: problem
    * 3 Situations at a Terminal
      * All lines terminate -> Timed-transfers
* Some terminate, some through -> middle case
* All lines through -> Maybe timed-transfer, if lots of transfers, but delays though passengers
  * Integrated Ticketing
  * Good Passenger Information
  * Traffic Control Center
    * incident management, passenger information, signal prioritization

### Fares

* Goals: equity, mode shift, make money
* Collection:
  * off vehicle: reduces dwell time
  * on vehicle
    * pay enter
    * pay leave
* Control
  * driver
  * gate
  * random checks

    * Gates
  * Structure
    * Flat-fare - Pros: simple; Cons: transfers are expensive
    * Distance-based - Pros: fair; Cons: can be very confusing
      * Check-In/Check-Out e.g. BART, Oyster Card (TfL)
      * Zone-based - Pros: fair; Cons: can be confusing
    * Time-based - Cons: delays affect fares
  * (Inter-agency) transfers e.g. [Integrated Ticketing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_ticketing)
  * Off-peak discount
  * Class: 1st, 2nd
  * Different fare for express service?
