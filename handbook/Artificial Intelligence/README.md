  * Tasks
    * Formal Tasks e.g. board games
    * Expert Tasks e.g. engineering design
    * Mundane Tasks e.g. walking
  * Driving Tasks
    * Localization and Mapping - Where am I?
    * Scene Understanding - Where is everyone else?
    * Movement Planning - Where am I going?
    * Driver State
  * Neural Networks (Deep Learning)
    * Universality - can approximate any function e.g. driving
    * Types
      * Multilayer Perception (MLP)
      * Deep Neural Networks (DNN)
      * Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
        * Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
      * Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN, ConvNet)
      * Deep Belief Networks (DBN)
    * Operations
      * Convolution
      * Pooling
      * Activation Function
      * Backpropagation
    * Components
      * Neurons
      * Synapses
      * [Perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron)
        1. weight
        2. sum
        3. activate
      * Input
        * [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org) [www.image-net.org]
      * Output
    * Learning Types
      * Supervised: provide large sample of training data (ground truth: inputs and outputs)
        * Humans can learn from much less data, simple instructions.
      * Reinforcement Learning: reward or punish based on just outcome, ground truth is scarce
      * Unsupervised: no information about outputs
