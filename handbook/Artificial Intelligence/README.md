  * Tasks
    * Formal Tasks e.g. board games
    * Expert Tasks e.g. engineering design
    * Mundane Tasks e.g. walking
  * Driving Tasks
    * Localization and Mapping - Where am I?
    * Scene Understanding - Where is everyone else?
    * Movement Planning - Where am I going?
    * Driver State
  * Neural Networks (Deep Learning)
    * Types
      * Multilayer Perception (MLP)
      * Deep Neural Networks (DNN)
      * Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
	* Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
      * Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN, ConvNet)
      * Deep Belief Networks (DBN)
    * Operations
      * Convolution
      * Pooling
      * Activation Function
      * Backpropagation
    * Neurons
    * Synapses
    * [Perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron)
    * Universality - can approximate any function e.g. driving
    * Learning Types
      * Supervised: provide large sample of training data (ground truth: inputs and outputs)
	* Humans can learn from much less data, simple instructions.
      * Reinforcement Learning: reward or punish based on just outcome, ground truth is scarce
      * Unsupervised: no information about outputs
