### [Research Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_design)

* Types of Studies
  * [Case-control study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case-control_study)
  * Before/After Study
  * [Cross-sectional study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-sectional_study)
  * [Meta-analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis)
  
### [Experimental design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_of_experiments)
* Full [factorial design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial_experiment)
* [Fractional factorial design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_factorial_design)
* [Robust parameter design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robust_parameter_design)
* [Sparsity-of-effects principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparsity-of-effects_principle)
* [Indicator function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicator_function) e.g. 1 if male, 0 if female
* [Latent class model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_class_model)
  * Latent variable: a variable we cannot directly observe: Observable variables -> Latent variable -> Observable outputs

### [Sensitivity analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_analysis)

### Model Calibration and Validation

* Minimize the Mean Square Error - always a good thing to try
* Number of runs determined by mean square error deviation and confidence interval

### High [Dimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension) Space

* [Curse of dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality)

### Communicating Information

* Principles
  * Figure/ground: one thing in the foreground and one thing in the background; bottom thing is always foreground
  * Proximity: we see things near each other as together
  * Similarity: things that look similar go together
  * Parallelism: parallel lines go together
  * Common Fate: things that move together go together
  * Closure: our brain completes the picture / sees what isnâ€™t there
  * Continuity: our brain fills gaps
* Visualizations
  * Tell a story. Start with a big header, then some introduction, then a bold call to action, then the data. Maybe add a little conclusion in a text box in the data. 
  * Headline: communicates the key idea of the story
  * Story: think of the story, then the data, then the visualization

  * [ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID)
  * [CAP theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem): Consistency,	Availability,	Partition tolerance - Pick 2 of 3
* Data Sources
  * Driving Simulators
  * Field studies: expensive and difficult

      * Online / App
      * Mail
    * Interview
      * In-person / focus groups
      * Telephone
    * Observations are usually more accurate
    * Helps understand why, not just what
    * Often miss special cases
  * Environmental Sensors (See Environmental Sensors)
  * Traffic Counts (See Traffic Counts)
