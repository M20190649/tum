### Communicating Information

* Principles
  * Figure/ground: one thing in the foreground and one thing in the background; bottom thing is always foreground
  * Proximity: we see things near each other as together
  * Similarity: things that look similar go together
  * Parallelism: parallel lines go together
  * Common Fate: things that move together go together
  * Closure: our brain completes the picture / sees what isnâ€™t there
  * Continuity: our brain fills gaps
* Visualizations
  * Tell a story. Start with a big header, then some introduction, then a bold call to action, then the data. Maybe add a little conclusion in a text box in the data. 
  * Headline: communicates the key idea of the story
  * Story: think of the story, then the data, then the visualization
* Presentations / Lectures
  * Types
    * Monologue: the presenter speaks the entire time
    * Guided Monlogue: the presenter acts as a guide and prompts the audience to provide the material
    * Seminar: the audience guides the discussion, may not cover all the material desired to be covered by the presenter
  * Multimedia: slides, pictures, video, posters, handouts
  * Questions: are good, allow for them
  * Exercises: can be good

### Models

* Requirements for Models
  * sensativity: as close to reality as necessary
  * logical consistancy: makes sense
  * operability: easy and cheap to use 
  * transparency: clear and understandable
  * reliability: same result with the same external conditions
  * validity: suitable for representation and analysis
* Model error is based on data error (measurement error) and specification error
  * Data error increases w/ complexity
  * Specification error decreases w/ complexity
* Types
  * Physical Models
  * Mathmatical (Relationship) Model e.g. function w/ inputs and outputs
    * Numerical and Analytical
  * Process Model e.g. complex system w/ many relationships, interfaces (input/output), and feedback loops
  * Modelling Platform e.g. a tool
* Properties
  * Static and Dynamic
  * Deterministic and Stochastic
  * Continuous and Discrete
* Objectives
  * Visualize/analyze/understand today
  * Predict the future w/ and w/o implementing changes to make a better decision today
* Calibration and Validation
  * Minimize the Mean Square Error - always a good thing to try
  * Number of runs determined by mean square error deviation and confidence interval

    * Observations are usually more accurate
    * Helps understand why, not just what
    * Often miss special cases
    * Reasonableness check: ask for individual satisfaction and overall satisfaction. they should match.
    Order of questions matters.
    * Provide Other, N/A, etc.
