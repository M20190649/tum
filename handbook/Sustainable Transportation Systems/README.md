	* http://transportationlca.org
  * Vision Zero
    * Origin: [September 3, 1967 (Dagen H)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagen_H)
    * Philosophy
      * "No one should be killed or seriously injured within the road traffic system"
	* Ethical approach, not uncontroversial
      * Road engineers share responsibility with road users via the road network
      * The road network must be built to allow people to make mistakes without fatal consequences, because people make mistakes
    * The Basics
      * Dense mixed-use neighborhoods
      * Walkability and cycleability
      * Attractive transit
      * Demand Management
    * Data Collection 
      * Things that get counted count more i.e. pedestrians and bikes are often neglected
      * STRADA
	* Inputs
	  * Police Data
	  * Hospital Data (much better for pedestrians and cyclists)
	* Outputs
	  * Traffic Crash Reports
	  * Prioritization of measures
	    * High fatality/injury rate in the area
	    * Children: schools, parks
	    * Poor speed compliance
	    * Wrong speed limit e.g. urban road with freeway speed limit
	  * Answers to questions from planners, government, media, people
	  * Measure of current situation
	  * Measure of effectiveness of specific projects
	  * Measure of effectiveness of Vision Zero program overall
    * Measures
      * Speed is one of the most important factors
	* Must set the right speed given the area and users
	  * Lots of pedestrians and cyclists in the area => lower speed
	  * Limited-access divided road => higher speed
	* Road design should communicate the right speed to drivers, not signs
	* Also set consistent speeds
      * Sidewalks and protected bike lanes
      * Roundabouts, raised pedestrian crossing, speed tables, speed bumps (with modifications for buses, police, fire, ambulances), chicanes, narrowing of the traffic lanes
	* Painted crosswalks and signals are an accessibility measure, not a safety measure because they do not prevent cars from hitting people. People do not have to slow or stop.
    * Communication is key: messages must speak to people, not engineers
  * Systematic Safety: Humans are vulnerable and make mistakes.
    1. Speed control and Separation
      6 mph - shared spaces
      20 mph - bicycles in mixed traffic - chicanes, speed humps, raised intersections
      25 mph - drivers yield for pedestrian crossings - narrow lanes, crossing islands, 1 lane per direction to prevent passing
      30 mph - 90 degree intersections
      40 mph - separate by direction e.g. median
      70 mph
    2. Functional harmony: avoid incompatible functions e.g. shops and through traffic
      a. Local streets 20 mph w/ parking, no lane markings, diverters to limit through traffic
      b. Neighborhood principals 25 mph: 1 lane/direction, lots of crossings
      c. Urban arterials 30 mph, signalized crossings, bike paths, no shops
      d. Regional roads, 45mph no local access
    3. Predictability and Simplicity: green bike lanes, crossing islands are simpler, turn lanes with dedicated arrows
    4. Forgiveness and restrictiveness: mistakes do not cause serious injury, prevent mistakes
    5. State awareness: drunk driving, texting, inexperience
  * [Bicycle Transportation Planning and Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_transportation_planning_and_engineering)
    * Features
      * Bicycles don't experience congestion (nearly as much as cars)
      * Bicycles don't pollute (increased health and land value)
      * Bicycles cost less (social mobility)
      * Bicycles don't take up space or divide communities
    * Germany: 4th grade bicycle test with police as part of school
  * Moving from Traditional (Car-focused) to Sustainable (People-focused)
    * Improve Walk, Bike, Public Transportation, Cars, Planes
      * Long timeline e.g. most Metros have taken 100 years to build, but bus lanes are quicker (cheaper)
      * Must happen before reducing cars
    * Demand is influenced by policy, price, etc., not a given
    * Design public transportation aroud people, not technology
      * Traditional approach: pick technology, fit city to technology, force people to adopt - results in high-costs and low ridership
      * Successful approach: design around people: network, easy, fast; evaluate options from the city perspective ($$$), decide
	* Mimic the good aspects of cars: e.g. high-speed, high-frequency (12+ vehicles/hr), high-quality e.g. BRT
  * Buzzword Bingo (Measures)
    * Public Transportation Priority
    * Non-motorized Transportaion
    * Public Spaces

    * Transportation Demand Management
    * High Quality Public Trasnportation
    * Land Use Policies

  * [Transport System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_network)
    * technical and orgazational structure for transport. e.g. track, vehicles, shoes, rules, services
    * Elements: Nodes (important for capacity/performance) and Links
    * Types: Road, Rail, Water, Air, Information, Relations, [Electricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_grid), [Telecommunications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_network)
    * Qualities
      * Connexity: are the points connected or not?
      * Connectivity: quality of interconnection = number of links / number of nodes. cul-de-sacs are poor connectivity
    * Shapes
      * Radial e.g. Los Angeles Metrolink
      * Radial Ring e.g. European motorways around a city

        * Up to 2km (30 minute walk) (more feeling than strict rule - could be shorter or longer)
        * Minimum 100 people/hectar for compact, walkable, bikeable.
        * Neighborhood is imporant for livable places, urban mobility, economic development, space/time efficency, pollution reduction, environmental friendliness, cost effectiveness, health, young and old mobility...
        * Neighborhood needs close destinations, network connections, bike/walk spaces, protection, a positive cultural climate, processes, involvement, data, tools.
        * Ground floor is the interaction between people and building - needs shops, restaurants, life - provides safety/security
        * Good things: parklets, benches, walking school bus, snow removal from sidewalk/bike lanes, slow/safe traffic, curb bulb-outs, elevated intersections, traffic island
        * Traffic Calming Areas - no priority for cars, max speed 4-7km/h, no sidewalk - hard for non-sighted orientation - still need a safe place. Similar to shared spaces.
        * Different speeds builds a hierarchy where cars naturally find faster streets - don't make everything slow
        * Traffic Calming goals - equality for all, more safe, less air and noise pollution | methods - shrink the road, disallow through traffic / shift vehicles to other streets, shift people to other modes
        * Marketing and communication
    * [Public Transportation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_transport)
      * dense in city center vs. car network which goes into the center, but is not dense in the center
      * Goals
        * Shift people from private transportation to public transportation by providing safe, reliable, efficient service
        * Shift public tranportation demand from peak hours to off peak hours
      * Planning <=> Operations
      * Infrastructure - Dedicated or Shared w/ Private Transport
        * Guideway: road or track
          * Right-of-Way Class
            * A: Exclusive right-of-way across nodes and links. e.g. LACMTA Red Line
            * B: Exclusive right-of-way across links; shared right-of-way across nodes. e.g. LACMTA Expo Line
            * C: Shared right-of-way across nodes and links. e.g. Buses
