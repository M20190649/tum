## [Sustainable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_transport) [Transportation Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_network)
* derived from sustainable forestry ([Hans Carl von Carlowitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Carl_von_Carlowitz))
* typical reasons for transportation projects (in order): efficency, safety, money, environment
* technical and orgazational structure for transport: infrastructure, vehicles, rules
* Elements: Nodes (important for capacity/performance) and Links
* Qualities
  * Connexity: are the points connected or not?
  * Connectivity: quality of interconnection = number of links / number of nodes. cul-de-sacs are poor connectivity
* Shapes
  * Radial e.g. Los Angeles Metrolink
  * Radial Ring e.g. European motorways around a city
  * Grid (Raster) e.g. Manhattan street network, Munich Maxvorstadt street network
* Scale
  * International
    * Airplane, (High-speed) Rail, Car/Bus
  * National
    * Airplane, (High-speed) Rail, Car/Bus
  * State
    * Airplane, (High-speed) Rail, Car/Bus
  * **Regional**
    * **Rail**, Car/Bus
    * [Functional Urban Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larger_urban_zone)
    * Polycentric to spread the demand, but keep it concentrated
    * Transit-oriented Development
    * Integration - professional, spatial, temporal, orgazational, methodological, poltical
  * County
    * Rail, Car/Bus
  * City
    * Rail, Car/Bus, Bicycle
  * **Neighborhood**
    * Car/Bus, **Bicycle**, **Walk**
    * Up to 2km (30 minute walk) (more feeling than strict rule - could be shorter or longer)
    * Minimum 100 people/hectar for compact, walkable, bikeable.
    * Neighborhood is imporant for livable places, urban mobility, economic development, space/time efficency, pollution reduction, environmental friendliness, cost effectiveness, health, young and old mobility...
    * Neighborhood needs close destinations, network connections, bike/walk spaces, protection, a positive cultural climate, processes, involvement, data, tools.
    * Ground floor is the interaction between people and building - needs shops, restaurants, life - provides safety/security
    * Good things: parklets, benches, walking school bus, snow removal from sidewalk/bike lanes, slow/safe traffic, curb bulb-outs, elevated intersections, traffic island
    * Traffic Calming Areas - no priority for cars, max speed 4-7km/h, no sidewalk - hard for non-sighted orientation - still need a safe place. Similar to shared spaces.
    * Different speeds builds a hierarchy where cars naturally find faster streets - don't make everything slow
    * Traffic Calming goals - equality for all, more safe, less air and noise pollution | methods - shrink the road, disallow through traffic / shift vehicles to other streets, shift people to other modes
    * Marketing and communication

  * [Bicycle Transportation Planning and Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_transportation_planning_and_engineering)
    * Features
      * Bicycles don't experience congestion (nearly as much as cars)
      * Bicycles don't pollute (increased health and land value)
      * Bicycles cost less (social mobility)
      * Bicycles don't take up space or divide communities
    * Germany: 4th grade bicycle test with police as part of school
  * Moving from Traditional (Car-focused) to Sustainable (People-focused)
    * Improve Walk, Bike, Public Transportation, Cars, Planes
      * Long timeline e.g. most Metros have taken 100 years to build, but bus lanes are quicker (cheaper)
      * Must happen before reducing cars
    * Demand is influenced by policy, price, etc., not a given
    * Design public transportation aroud people, not technology
      * Traditional approach: pick technology, fit city to technology, force people to adopt - results in high-costs and low ridership
      * Successful approach: design around people: network, easy, fast; evaluate options from the city perspective ($$$), decide
	* Mimic the good aspects of cars: e.g. high-speed, high-frequency (12+ vehicles/hr), high-quality e.g. BRT

        * Advantages: high geographical network coverage, reduced travel times due to optimized connections, simpler timetable, improved punctuality, continuous operation, reduction of empty trips
        * Disadvantages: high long-term investments in infrastructure, infrastructure is not used to capacity, high peak traffic at nodes, increase in travel time for some trips, requires prioritization of people over freight
