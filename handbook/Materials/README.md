## Materials

### Material Safety

* Levels of Safety
  * In Use: Functions Safely
  * Functional Safety: Fail-Safe
  * Product Safety: Legally Provable
* Types of Use
  * Intended
  * Foreseeable
  * Intentional Misuse
* Risk = Severity × Probability × Controllability
* Risk should improve safety overall
