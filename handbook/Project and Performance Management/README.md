## Project and Performance Management

### SVS Engineering Process

* Design the system
* Simulate the system in software
* Step-by-step, replace each componenet of the simulation with hardware until you have a complete system

### Project Management

* Goal: Sustainable Transportation
  * Vision: long-term goal
  * Strategy: medium-term plans
  * Action: short-term projects
* Principles: Comprehensive, Efficient, Inclusive, Informative, Integrated, Logical, Transparent
* Integration: Technical, Spatial, Temporal, Organizational, Methodological, Political
* Stakeholders: Customers, Operators, Management, Society
* Process
  * Problem Statement and Goal
  * Brainstorm Alternatives
    * [Feasibility Studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feasibility_study)

  * Outcomes-Based Approach
    * We may have accountability - people put money in, they get projects out, they are happy.
    * We do not have transparency - we can't follow the money.
    * Steps
      * Transparency: Maintain taxpayer confidence
      * Accountability: Deliver value
      * Value: best bang for the buck
      * Resolve conflicts between policies
      * Get more funding…
