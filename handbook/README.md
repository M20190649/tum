## [Land Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_use) and Transport
  * Land Use -> Transport -> Land Use... (Feedback Loop, and Chicken and Egg Problem)
  ![wulfhorst2003](https://github.com/davidbailey/tum/raw/master/handbook/wulfhorst2003.png)
  * Land Use -> Activity -> Transport (Supply <-> Demand) -> Accessibility -> Land Use...
    * [Activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_(philosophy))
      * Routine - regular and predictable
      * Institutional - irregular and according to lifestyle
      * Production - complex network of relationships between firms, activities, regions, nations
    * Accessibility
      * "The more or less easiness with which one can reach a location (a) to perform an activity (b)" - both geometric and economic
      * Accessibility = Σ(destinations * function of generalized costs)
      * Density, Diversity, Design
      * Depends on costs (time, money) and perception of those costs.
        * Monetary Budget ~ 15% of household budget
        * Time Budget ~ 1 hour/day, stable through history - we are traveling further today, not more; if we have free time in our budget, we use it to increase happiness
          * [Marchetti's Constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marchetti%27s_constant)
      * Increase accessibility by increasing the quality of the transport system or increasing the number of activities in an area. An increase in accessibility causes positive feedback in the loop. This is balanced by negative feedback from the transport system. When transportation demand goes up, quality goes down. e.g. traffic, overcrowding.
      * Action Space
        * where your activities take place
        * Capacity constraints - money, time, availability modes
        * Coupling constraints - location, time
        * Insitutional constraints - opening hours, entrance fee
      * Land use and public transport accessibility index (LUPTAI) tool
        * Build pubilc transport where it is lacking and there is high density
        * Increase density where it is low and there is good public transport

      * [Friction of Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction_of_distance)
        * spacial distance, temporal distance, traffic-dependent, mode-dependent
      * [Mobility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobilities)
        * ability to move - related to an activity - individual perspective, depends on [Built Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Built_environment)
        * Mobility Rate
          * number of trips/person/day
    * [Transport System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_network)
      * technical and orgazational structure for transport. e.g. track, vehicles, shoes, rules, services
      * Elements: Nodes (important for capacity/performance) and Links
      * Types: Road, Rail, Water, Air, Information, Relations, [Electricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_grid), [Telecommunications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_network)
      * Qualities
        * Connexity: are the points connected or not?
        * Connectivity: quality of interconnection = number of links / number of nodes. cul-de-sacs are poor connectivity
      * Shapes
        * Radial e.g. Los Angeles Metrolink
        * Radial Ring e.g. European motorways around a city
        * Grid (Raster) e.g. Manhattan street network, Munich Maxvorstadt street network
      * Scale
        * International

        * **Regional**
          * **Rail**, Car/Bus
          * [Functional Urban Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larger_urban_zone)
          * Polycentric to spread the demand, but keep it concentrated
          * Transit-oriented Development
          * Integration - professional, spatial, temporal, orgazational, methodological, poltical
        * County
          * Rail, Car/Bus
        * City
          * Rail, Car/Bus, Bicycle
        * **Neighborhood**
          * Car/Bus, **Bicycle**, **Walk**
          * Up to 2km (30 minute walk) (more feeling than strict rule - could be shorter or longer)
          * Minimum 100 people/hectar for compact, walkable, bikeable.
          * Neighborhood is imporant for livable places, urban mobility, economic development, space/time efficency, pollution reduction, environmental friendliness, cost effectiveness, health, young and old mobility...
          * Neighborhood needs close destinations, network connections, bike/walk spaces, protection, a positive cultural climate, processes, involvement, data, tools.
          * Ground floor is the interaction between people and building - needs shops, restaurants, life - provides safety/security
          * Good things: parklets, benches, walking school bus, snow removal from sidewalk/bike lanes, slow/safe traffic, curb bulb-outs, elevated intersections, traffic island
          * Traffic Calming Areas - no priority for cars, max speed 4-7km/h, no sidewalk - hard for non-sighted orientation - still need a safe place. Similar to shared spaces.
          * Different speeds builds a hierarchy where cars naturally find faster streets - don't make everything slow
          * Traffic Calming goals - equality for all, more safe, less air and noise pollution | methods - shrink the road, disallow through traffic / shift vehicles to other streets, shift people to other modes
          * Marketing and communication
      * [Public Transportation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_transport)
        * dense in city center vs. car network which goes into the center, but is not dense in the center
        * Goals
          * Shift people from private transportation to public transportation by providing safe, reliable, efficient service
          * Shift public tranportation demand from peak hours to off peak hours
        * Planning <=> Operations
        * Infrastructure - Dedicated or Shared w/ Private Transport
          * Guideway: road or track
            * Right-of-Way Class
              * A: Exclusive right-of-way across nodes and links. e.g. LACMTA Red Line
              * B: Exclusive right-of-way across links; shared right-of-way across nodes. e.g. LACMTA Expo Line
              * C: Shared right-of-way across nodes and links. e.g. Buses

    * Midevil cities built around walking and defense. Compact, dense, sometimes overcrowded, human scale. Everything mixed-use. No street grid. Size limited by 30 minute walk (2-3km) from one side to the other. Often located at the junction (node) of two trade routes (links) (e.g. Munich) -> Walking city
    * Industrial revolution (1840s): invention of the train. Allowed people to move out of the city center because they could travel faster than walking. At the same time, improved farming technology caused people to move to cities. Development concentrated around train stations (tram, subway, commuter rail, etc.) (Transit-oriented Development) on lines radiating out from city center. Garden City movement (1898 Sir Ebenezer Howard). Beginning of seperation of uses: industry, residential, commercial. -> Transit city
    * Post World War II (1950s): dramatic increase in car ownership and development away from public transport (suburban). High amount of uncoordinated growth. Increasing seperation of uses (residential, job centers, commercial, industrial) (zoning). Airplanes for long distance transportation. -> Car city
    * Future? Autonomous cars: how will this change travel and cities? Will people choose to live further from work because they can be productive during their commute? But we already have commuter trains. Will cities no longer have parking? Will traffic congestion get better or worse? Shared mobility: will people own cars? More walking and cycling?

		  * Signalized Intersection Design Process
		    1. Find complementary signals: analyze the intersection geometry and determine conflict points (conflicting signals).
		    2. Define which signal belong to which phases and choose an appropriate sequence of phases.
		    3. Determine inter-green times based conflict mode, type, geometry, and speed.
		    4. Determine saturation flow based on number of lanes * adjustment factors
		    5. Determine traffic volumes per stream
		    6. Determine cycle time between 60 and 120 seconds
		    7. Calculate necessary green times including minimum green times.
		    8. Calculate available green time = cycle time - sum of intergreen times
		    9. Determine capacity of the intersection = sum of all capacities = green time for each flow * saturation flow for each flow from 4.
		    10. Determine degree of saturation (highest of all flows) for all movements and assign a quality.
		    11. Set the signal plan.

                      * Distance between intersections < 750-1000m
                      * Coordinated cycle time across all intersections
                      * Progresssion speed = 0.85 * speed limit to speed limit => offset time
                      * Level of saturation < 0.85 for coordinated stream and < 0.9 for other streams
                      * More than one lane for through traffic
                      * Dedicated left turn lanes
                      * No non-signalized pedestrian crossings
                      * Limited parking
                      * Fixed distance between intersections (for 2-way coordination). Otherwise coordinate 1-way in AM and other way in PM
                    * Procedure
                      1. Define a cyce time for coordination, highest wins
                      2. Calculate signal timing plans for intersections
                      3. Define schedule of green periods based on progression speed and offset. Add 4.5 seconds the beginning of the phase to disolve queues but not more so you don't encourage speeding.
                      4. Assess quality
                        * number of vehicles that do not have to stop / total number of vehicles >= 65% is good

              * Local = space is constant, time is variable overcounts fast vehicles = higher than momentary
              * Momentary = time is constant, space is variable
          * Four-step Model
            * Purpose
              * [Transportation Forcasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_forecasting)
            * Assumptions / Recommendations
              * Zones (and traffic to/from a zone) is consolidated into one point via a connector. Lot of calibration needed here.
              * Create single-use zones. e.g. all residential, all commercial, etc.
              * Use natural and political boundaries if appropriate.
              * Create smaller zones in more dense areas
              * Create a study area bigger than the planning area
              * Does not consider feedback between land use and transportation
              * Does not consider feedback between the four stages.
              * Mode choice is done after destination choice
              * Ignores internal trips and through trips (to/from outside the region)
              * Ignores trip chaining
            * Required Information
              * Links: speeds, capacity (number of lanes), congestion, permissible transport modes, public transport lines
              * Nodes: capacity, turn restrictions, mean delay time for each traffic stream, public transport stops
            * Steps
              * Trip Generation
                * Number of person/vehicle trips entering or leaving a zone.
                * Structural data (population, jobs, square feet of retail space, number of seats, etc.) * Mobility rate for that data
                * Hopefully this is symmetric. e.g. number of people who leave for work = number of people who arrive at work.
              * Trip Distribution
                * Based on a gravity function Tij = Oi * Dj * f(cij)
                  * Tij = trips from i to j
                  * Oi = trips w/ origin i
                  * Dj = trips w/ destination j
                  * cij = resistance based on distance, travel time, costs, etc.
                  * f() = deterrence function e.g. power function or exponential function
                * Not necessarily symmetric.
                * Big problem is a lack of understanding of spacial decision making. E.g. what if you visit a friend across town?
              * Mode Choice
                * Generalized cost term (utility) = (time + cost + comfort) * perception of each
                * Based on the person (income, car availability, etc.) and the mode (travel time, comfort, etc.)
                * Public transport times from timetable/reality
                * Time includes wait time, access time (walk to car or public tranportation)
                * Comfort includes stress, reliability, safety, etc.
                * Captive riders must use public transportation (no car). Captive drivers must drive (no public tranportation).

              * Route Assignment
                * Car: which roads to take
                * Public transportation: which lines, which transfers
                * Inputs are travel demands (O/D Matrix, mode choice), transportation network with qualities for each mode, and a methodology for route choice and assignment
                * Convert from input (people) to output (vehicles) by dividing by an occupancy rate e.g. 1.1 people/vehicle for commuting
                * Outputs are impacts: traffic, congestion, noise, air pollution, loads on nodes and links
                * Methods
                  * All or nothing
                    1. Route identification for each O/D pair
                    2. Route choice
                    3. Load routes onto the network
                    4. Evaluate the effects of congestion on 1.
                  * Capacity-restraint function
                    * t = t0 * (1 + a * (V / C) ^ b
                      * t = congested travel time
                      * t0 = free flow travel time
                      * V = traffic volume on the link
                      * C = capacity of the link
                      * a,b = parameters
                    * Iterative method. e.g. add 50%, then 30%, then 20%
                * Limitations
                  * Drivers do not assign themselves logically and change assignments over time
                  * Congestion affects destination choice, mode choice, whether to take the trip at all

              * m = number of service points
              * n = number of waiting places before entering the system
              * e.g. One Lane @ Traffic Signal = A/B/1/1; Two Lanes @ Traffic Signal = A/B/1/2; Toll Plaza w/ 3 approaching lanes and 5 gates = A/B/5/3
          * ~ 2 seconds / vehicle to leave the queue
          * [Degree of Saturation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_saturation_(traffic)) 
            * Deterministic Degree of Saturation = r = Arrival Volume / Capacity e.g. Traffic Signal
              * r > 1 = oversaturated (realistic here)
              * at a traffic signal r = Arrival Rate / (Service Rate * α) where α = Effective Greentime / Cycle Length
            * Stochastic Degree of Saturation = ρ = Arrival Rate / Service Rate e.g. Toll Gate
              * ρ < 1 = undersaturation (realistic here)
              * mean waiting time = 1 / (Service Rate - Arrival Rate)
              * mean queue length = Arrival Rate / (Service Rate - Arrival Rate)
            * Use Stochastic for ρ < 1 and Deterministic for r > 1. Problem at 1.

      * Purpose
        * Study things too expensive, too dangerous, not possible
        * Compare multiple options
      * Benefits
        * Less cost, less time, less risk
        * Detailed data about all components
        * Reproducible, modifiable
      * Be careful what you define as the system. E.g. if you only consider current drivers, induced demand doesn't exist, but we know it does... In reality, the transportation system is global (or greater)

	* http://transportationlca.org
  * Vision Zero
    * Origin: [September 3, 1967 (Dagen H)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagen_H)
    * Philosophy
      * "No one should be killed or seriously injured within the road traffic system"
	* Ethical approach, not uncontroversial
      * Road engineers share responsibility with road users via the road network
      * The road network must be built to allow people to make mistakes without fatal consequences, because people make mistakes
    * The Basics
      * Dense mixed-use neighborhoods
      * Walkability and cycleability
      * Attractive transit
      * Demand Management
    * Data Collection 
      * Things that get counted count more i.e. pedestrians and bikes are often neglected
      * STRADA
	* Inputs
	  * Police Data
	  * Hospital Data (much better for pedestrians and cyclists)
	* Outputs
	  * Traffic Crash Reports
	  * Prioritization of measures
	    * High fatality/injury rate in the area
	    * Children: schools, parks
	    * Poor speed compliance
	    * Wrong speed limit e.g. urban road with freeway speed limit
	  * Answers to questions from planners, government, media, people
	  * Measure of current situation
	  * Measure of effectiveness of specific projects
	  * Measure of effectiveness of Vision Zero program overall
    * Measures
      * Speed is one of the most important factors
	* Must set the right speed given the area and users
	  * Lots of pedestrians and cyclists in the area => lower speed
	  * Limited-access divided road => higher speed
	* Road design should communicate the right speed to drivers, not signs
	* Also set consistent speeds
      * Sidewalks and protected bike lanes
      * Roundabouts, raised pedestrian crossing, speed tables, speed bumps (with modifications for buses, police, fire, ambulances), chicanes, narrowing of the traffic lanes
	* Painted crosswalks and signals are an accessibility measure, not a safety measure because they do not prevent cars from hitting people. People do not have to slow or stop.
    * Communication is key: messages must speak to people, not engineers
  * Systematic Safety: Humans are vulnerable and make mistakes.
    1. Speed control and Separation
      6 mph - shared spaces
      20 mph - bicycles in mixed traffic - chicanes, speed humps, raised intersections
      25 mph - drivers yield for pedestrian crossings - narrow lanes, crossing islands, 1 lane per direction to prevent passing
      30 mph - 90 degree intersections
      40 mph - separate by direction e.g. median
      70 mph
    2. Functional harmony: avoid incompatible functions e.g. shops and through traffic
      a. Local streets 20 mph w/ parking, no lane markings, diverters to limit through traffic
      b. Neighborhood principals 25 mph: 1 lane/direction, lots of crossings
      c. Urban arterials 30 mph, signalized crossings, bike paths, no shops
      d. Regional roads, 45mph no local access
    3. Predictability and Simplicity: green bike lanes, crossing islands are simpler, turn lanes with dedicated arrows
    4. Forgiveness and restrictiveness: mistakes do not cause serious injury, prevent mistakes
    5. State awareness: drunk driving, texting, inexperience
  * [Bicycle Transportation Planning and Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_transportation_planning_and_engineering)
    * Features
      * Bicycles don't experience congestion (nearly as much as cars)
      * Bicycles don't pollute (increased health and land value)
      * Bicycles cost less (social mobility)
      * Bicycles don't take up space or divide communities
    * Germany: 4th grade bicycle test with police as part of school
  * Moving from Traditional (Car-focused) to Sustainable (People-focused)
    * Improve Walk, Bike, Public Transportation, Cars, Planes
      * Long timeline e.g. most Metros have taken 100 years to build, but bus lanes are quicker (cheaper)
      * Must happen before reducing cars
    * Demand is influenced by policy, price, etc., not a given
    * Design public transportation aroud people, not technology
      * Traditional approach: pick technology, fit city to technology, force people to adopt - results in high-costs and low ridership
      * Successful approach: design around people: network, easy, fast; evaluate options from the city perspective ($$$), decide
	* Mimic the good aspects of cars: e.g. high-speed, high-frequency (12+ vehicles/hr), high-quality e.g. BRT
  * Buzzword Bingo (Measures)
    * Public Transportation Priority
    * Non-motorized Transportaion

    * Transportation Demand Management
    * High Quality Public Trasnportation
    * Land Use Policies

      * We may have accountability - people put money in, they get projects out, they are happy.
      * We do not have transparency - we can't follow the money.
      * Steps
	1. Transparency: Maintain taxpayer confidence
	2. Accountability: Deliver value
	3. Value: best bang for the buck
	4. Resolve conflicts between policies
	5. Get more funding…
