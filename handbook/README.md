1. [Land Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_use) and Transport
  * Land Use -> Transport -> Land Use... (Feedback Loop, and Chicken and Egg Problem)
  ![wulfhorst2003](https://github.com/davidbailey/tum/raw/master/handbook/wulfhorst2003.png)
  * Land Use -> Activity -> Transport (Supply <-> Demand) -> Accessibility -> Land Use...
    * [Activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_(philosophy))
      * Routine - regular and predictable
      * Institutional - irregular and according to lifestyle
      * Production - complex network of relationships between firms, activities, regions, nations
    * Accessibility
      * "The more or less easiness with which one can reach a location (a) to perform an activity (b)" - both geometric and economic
      * Accessibility = sum(destinations * function of generalized costs)
      * Density, Diversity, Design
      * Depends on costs (time, money) and perception of those costs.
        * Monetary Budget ~ 15% of household budget
        * Time Budget ~ 1 hour/day, stable through history - we are traveling further today, not more; if we have free time in our budget, we use it to increase happiness
          * [Marchetti's Constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marchetti%27s_constant)
      * Increase accessibility by increasing the quality of the transport system or increasing the number of activities in an area. An increase in accessibility causes positive feedback in the loop. This is balanced by negative feedback from the transport system. When transportation demand goes up, quality goes down. e.g. traffic, overcrowding.
      * Action Space
        * where your activities take place
        * Capacity constraints - money, time, availability modes
        * Coupling constraints - location, time
        * Insitutional constraints - opening hours, entrance fee
      * Land use and public transport accessibility index (LUPTAI) tool
        * Build pubilc transport where it is lacking and there is high density
        * Increase density where it is low and there is good public transport

      * [Friction of Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction_of_distance)
        * spacial distance, temporal distance, traffic-dependent, mode-dependent
      * [Mobility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobilities)
        * ability to move - related to an activity - individual perspective, depends on [Built Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Built_environment)
        * Mobility Rate
          * number of trips/person/day
    * [Transport System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_network)
      * technical and orgazational structure for transport. e.g. track, vehicles, shoes, rules, services
      * Elements: Nodes (important for capacity/performance) and Links
      * Types: Road, Rail, Water, Air, Information, Relations, [Electricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_grid), [Telecommunications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_network)
      * Qualities
        * Connexity: are the points connected or not?
        * Connectivity: quality of interconnection = number of links / number of nodes. cul-de-sacs are poor connectivity
      * Shapes
        * Radial e.g. Los Angeles Metrolink
        * Radial Ring e.g. European motorways around a city
        * Grid (Raster) e.g. Manhattan street network, Munich Maxvorstadt street network
      * Scale

          * [Functional Urban Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larger_urban_zone)
          * Polycentric to spread the demand, but keep it concentrated
          * Transit-oriented Development
          * Integration - professional, spatial, temporal, orgazational, methodological, poltical
        * County
          * Rail, Car/Bus
        * City
          * Rail, Car/Bus, Bicycle
        * **Neighborhood**
          * Car/Bus, **Bicycle**, **Walk**
          * Up to 2km (30 minute walk) (more feeling than strict rule - could be shorter or longer)
          * Minimum 100 people/hectar for compact, walkable, bikeable.
          * Neighborhood is imporant for livable places, urban mobility, economic development, space/time efficency, pollution reduction, environmental friendliness, cost effectiveness, health, young and old mobility...
          * Neighborhood needs close destinations, network connections, bike/walk spaces, protection, a positive cultural climate, processes, involvement, data, tools.
          * Ground floor is the interaction between people and building - needs shops, restaurants, life - provides safety/security
          * Good things: parklets, benches, walking school bus, snow removal from sidewalk/bike lanes, slow/safe traffic, curb bulb-outs, elevated intersections, traffic island
          * Traffic Calming Areas - no priority for cars, max speed 4-7km/h, no sidewalk - hard for non-sighted orientation - still need a safe place. Similar to shared spaces.
          * Different speeds builds a hierarchy where cars naturally find faster streets - don't make everything slow
          * Traffic Calming goals - equality for all, more safe, less air and noise pollution | methods - shrink the road, disallow through traffic / shift vehicles to other streets, shift people to other modes
          * Marketing and communication
      * [Public Transportation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_transport)
        * dense in city center vs. car network which goes into the center, but is not dense in the center
        * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0OGqjPS47E
        * Integrated Synchronized Timetable (Timed Transfer)
          * when vehicles from two differnt lines have matching frequencies (typically 1 to 12 trains/hour) and meet each other across a platform at a certain station within 30 seconds to 5 minutes of each other. ticket/fare integation too.
      * Transport Offer
        * network + services

  * History
    * Midevil cities built around walking and defense. Compact, dense, sometimes overcrowded, human scale. Everything mixed-use. No street grid. Size limited by 30 minute walk (2-3km) from one side to the other. Often located at the junction (node) of two trade routes (links) (e.g. Munich) -> Walking city
    * Industrial revolution (1840s): invention of the train. Allowed people to move out of the city center because they could travel faster than walking. At the same time, improved farming technology caused people to move to cities. Development concentrated around train stations (tram, subway, commuter rail, etc.) (Transit-oriented Development) on lines radiating out from city center. Garden City movement (1898 Sir Ebenezer Howard). Beginning of seperation of uses: industry, residential, commercial. -> Transit city
    * Post World War II (1950s): dramatic increase in car ownership and development away from public transport (suburban). High amount of uncoordinated growth. Increasing seperation of uses (residential, job centers, commercial, industrial) (zoning). Airplanes for long distance transportation. -> Car city
    * Future? Autonomous cars: how will this change travel and cities? Will people choose to live further from work because they can be productive during their commute? But we already have commuter trains. Will cities no longer have parking? Will traffic congestion get better or worse? Shared mobility: will people own cars? More walking and cycling?
