  * Process
    * Choose independent variables.
    * Analyse the relationship between independent variable and the dependent variable.
      * If the relationship is non-linear, apply a suitable transformation. e.g. log()
    * Calculate the correlation table for all possible variable pairs.
      * If two variables are collinear, choose the one wit the hightest correlation.
    * Add variables to the model depending on if they improve model accuracy. Otherwise, reject them.
    * Finalize statistical indices of the model.
      * Coefficient of Determination
      * Standard Error of the Estimate

### Station Design Process

* Selecting Turnouts
  * Determine the maximum speed through each turnout.
  * Determine the spacing between all tracks.
    * 4m if no signals
    * 4.5m if signals
    * 8m+ if platforms
  * Using the above information, find the radius (from speed) and inclination (from speed and spacing) from a table.
  * Note: the minimum speed is 50kph.
* Entry signals
  * Each entry gets a signal. Determine the danger point.
  * Number signals A-E from the left and F-J from the right.
  * Determine the maximum speed through the signal.
  * Using the above information, find the distance to danger.
    * speed <= 40kph: 50m
    * 40kph < speed <= 60kph: 100m
    * \> 60kph: 200m
      * Note: If there is no risk of these movements => not decisive.
* Exit Signals (simultaneous train runs first)
  * Each exit gets a signal. Determine the danger point.
  * Number signals N# from the left and P# from the right. # is the track number.
  * Determine the maximum speed thought the signal.
  * Using the above information, find the distance to danger.
    * speed <= 40kph: 50m
    * 40kph < speed <= 60kph: 100m
    * \> 60kph: 200m
      * Note: If there is no risk of these movements => not decisive.

              * Calculate available green time = cycle time - sum of intergreen times
              * Determine capacity of the intersection = sum of all capacities = green time for each flow * saturation flow for each flow from 4.
              * Determine degree of saturation (highest of all flows) for all movements and assign a quality.

                * Progresssion speed = 0.85 * speed limit to speed limit => offset time
                * Level of saturation < 0.85 for coordinated stream and < 0.9 for other streams

## [Land Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_use) and Transport Interactions

People outside cities (who most often drive) think of corridors (often freeways) because they always go the same way to and from their homes. People in cities (walking, cycling, transiting, driving) think of networks because they can go in any direction from their homes.

### History

* Midevil cities built around walking and defense. Compact, dense, sometimes overcrowded, human scale. Everything mixed-use. No street grid. Size limited by 30 minute walk (2-3km) from one side to the other. Often located at the junction (node) of two trade routes (links) (e.g. Munich) -> Walking city
* Industrial revolution (1840s): invention of the train. Allowed people to move out of the city center because they could travel faster than walking. At the same time, improved farming technology caused people to move to cities. Development concentrated around train stations (tram, subway, commuter rail, etc.) (Transit-oriented Development) on lines radiating out from city center. Garden City movement (1898 Sir Ebenezer Howard). Beginning of seperation of uses: industry, residential, commercial. -> Transit city
* Post World War II (1950s): dramatic increase in car ownership and development away from public transport (suburban). High amount of uncoordinated growth. Increasing seperation of uses (residential, job centers, commercial, industrial) (zoning). Airplanes for long distance transportation. -> Car city
* Future?
  * Autonomous cars: how will this change travel and cities? Will people choose to live further from work because they can be productive during their commute? But we already have commuter trains. Will cities no longer have parking? Will traffic congestion get better or worse? Shared mobility: will people own cars? More walking and cycling?
  * Peak Car, growth (population, vmt) is not always up and to the right, other modes of transportation (e.g. Hyperloop, (e-)cycling, Internet) => What If Scinerios (Models + Experts)

* Components: Spacial, Transport, Temporal, Individual
* Increase accessibility by increasing the quality of the transport system or increasing the number of activities in an area. An increase in accessibility causes positive feedback in the loop. This is balanced by negative feedback from the transport system. When transportation demand goes up, quality goes down. e.g. traffic, overcrowding.

### Right-of-Way

* [rail-bus differences: premise or conclusion?](http://humantransit.org/2011/03/rail-bus-differences-contd.html) [humantransit.org]
* A: Dedicated ways and intersections e.g. LACMTA Red Line
* B: Dedicated ways and shared intersections e.g. LACMTA Expo Line
  * possibility for intersection prioritization
* C: Shared ways and intersetions e.g. Buses

Right-of-Way Class | A | B | C
--- | --- | --- | ---
Investment Cost | high | medium | low
Operating Cost (per passenger) | low | medium | high
Speed | high | medium | low (slower than private cars)
Travel Time Reliability | high | medium | low
Capacity | high | medium | low

### Vehicle Guidance

* Track / Guideway
  * allows for longer vehicles (higher capacity), less land use, better for tunnels, safety/automation possible
  * higher cost, higher stop spacing, less flexibility
* Driver Steered

### Propulsion

* Dinosaurs: Diesel, CNG, LNG
* Electric
  * higher acceleration, regenerative braking, no local pollution
  * higher investment cost, less reliable
* Hybrid

### Control

* Driver
* Automatic Train Operation
  * lowest headways, higher cost
  * w/ Driver
  * w/o Driver
    * lower cost

### Line Length

* Long: more direct trips, more efficient (less down time)
* Short: less delay propagation, difficult run cutting

### Interconnections

* Integrated
  * more direct trips/options, can schedule to match passenger demand, rerouting possible
  * more complex
  * common for bus networks
* Independent
  * greater overall capacity, less delay propegation, less complex
  * common for large networks in big cities

### Lines

* Radial
  * one terminal in city, one in suburbs
  * service follows demand direction, unbalanced demand
  * decreasing passenger volume outward from city
    * can run short lines from city
    * can branch
  * poor connectivity, terminals in city = poor use of space
  * w/ Loop
  * [Der MVV Netzplan - Eine Zeitreise von 1972 bis heute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0OGqjPS47E) [www.youtube.com]
* Diametrical
  * radial, but through city
  * balance demand on both sides, unbalanced demand city to suburb
  * better connectivity than radial, better use of space
  * delay propegation
  * L-shape = better connectivity, more direct trips
  * U-shape: balance demand between lines
* Tangential
  * typically low demand
* Circle
  * great for connectivity, suburb to suburb
  * vulnerable to delay propegation, headway must be integer fraction of the cycle time
    * open the circle
    * go slower than maximum possible -> speed up when delayed
    * stop at station w/ most transfers, fewest through passengers
  * Loop e.g. Singapore LRT
* Trunk
  * solves demand problem
  * rail2rail: requires coordination of schedules, infrastructure, better passenger experience
  * w/ Branches
    * direct, longer lines
  * rail2road: cheaper/easier
  * w/ Feeder
    * no delay propagation, can use different modes

### Networks

* Radial
  * service follows demand direction, unbalanced demand, high passenger value
  * few transfers (not possible)
* Radial/Cicumfrential
  * suburb2suburb, better connectivity
* Grid
  * good connectivity, lots of transfers
  * useful for all trip types
* Ubiquitous
  * many direct trips, lots of connectivity
  * useful for all trip types
* Irregular
  * service follows geography

### Integration (Transfers)

* No Transfers: Commuter or Highly Integrated
* Transfers: High Capacity Independent Lines
  * Hierarchical Structure: Functions: keep seperate
    * Collection/distribution - accessible, e.g. bus
    * Long-distance transport - fast, e.g. rail
  * perceived travel time with transfers must be less than perceived travel time w/ direct service
* Requirements
  * Network Design / Transfer Stations
    * e.g. Timed-transfer Stations
  * Schedule Coordination
    * uniform headway - easy to remember, balanced passenger loads -> less bunching
    * timed transfers ((Integrated) Synchronized Timetable): arrive together, wait a bit, depart together
      * when vehicles from two differnt lines have matching frequencies (typically 1 to 12 trains/hour) and meet each other across a platform at a certain station within 30 seconds to 5 minutes of each other. ticket/fare integation too.
      * Advantages: high geographical network coverage, reduced travel times due to optimized connections, simpler timetable, improved punctuality, continuous operation, reduction of empty trips
      * Disadvantages: high long-term investments in infrastructure, infrastructure is not used to capacity, high peak traffic at nodes, increase in travel time for some trips, requires prioritization of people over freight
    * short2short: no problem
    * long2short: no problem
    * short2long: publish timetable
    * long2long: same headway: timed transfer or only-one way transfers (one arrives and departs before the other), different headway: problem
    * 3 Situations at a Terminal
      * All lines terminate -> Timed-transfers
* Some terminate, some through -> middle case
* All lines through -> Maybe timed-transfer, if lots of transfers, but delays though passengers
  * Integrated Ticketing
  * Good Passenger Information
  * Traffic Control Center
    * incident management, passenger information, signal prioritization

* [Curse of dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality)

### Communicating Information

* Principles
  * Figure/ground: one thing in the foreground and one thing in the background; bottom thing is always foreground
  * Proximity: we see things near each other as together
  * Similarity: things that look similar go together
  * Parallelism: parallel lines go together
  * Common Fate: things that move together go together
  * Closure: our brain completes the picture / sees what isn’t there
  * Continuity: our brain fills gaps
* Visualizations
  * Tell a story. Start with a big header, then some introduction, then a bold call to action, then the data. Maybe add a little conclusion in a text box in the data. 
  * Headline: communicates the key idea of the story
  * Story: think of the story, then the data, then the visualization

## [Road Safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_traffic_safety)

We don't tolerate buildings where people die in accidents, but we do tolerate roads where people die in accidents.

### Measures

### Measuring Road Safety

* Pyramid
  * Fatal crashes
  * Severe injury crashes
  * injury crashes
  * damage only crashes
  * near crashes
  * slight conflicts
  * potential conflicts
  * no conflict
* Direct measures: fatalities, crashes
  * But these events are rare, often unreported, and are difficult to simulate
* Indirect measures: conflicts, time-to-collision, post-encroachment time, headway
  * More frequent, easier to simulate, but not reality

### Vulnerable Road Users

* [Pedestrians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedestrian)
  * [Pedestrian safety through vehicle design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedestrian_safety_through_vehicle_design)
* Cyclists
* Motorcyclists
* Children and elderly people

### [Vision Zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_Zero)

* Origin: [September 3, 1967 (Dagen H)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagen_H)
* Philosophy: "No one should be killed or seriously injured within the road traffic system"
  * Ethical approach, not uncontroversial
  * Road engineers share responsibility with road users via the road network
  * The road network must be built to allow people to make mistakes without fatal consequences, because people make mistakes
* The Basics
  * Dense mixed-use neighborhoods
  * Walkability and cycleability
  * Attractive transit
  * Demand Management
* Data Collection
  * Things that get counted count more i.e. pedestrians and bikes are often neglected
  * STRADA
* Inputs
  * Police Data
  * Hospital Data (much better for pedestrians and cyclists)
* Outputs
  * Traffic Crash Reports
  * Prioritization of measures
    * High fatality/injury rate in the area
    * Children: schools, parks
    * Poor speed compliance
    * Wrong speed limit e.g. urban road with freeway speed limit
  * Answers to questions from planners, government, media, people
  * Measure of current situation
  * Measure of effectiveness of specific projects
  * Measure of effectiveness of Vision Zero program overall
* Measures
  * Speed is one of the most important factors
    * Must set the right speed given the area and users
    * Lots of pedestrians and cyclists in the area => lower speed
    * Limited-access divided road => higher speed
    * Road design should communicate the right speed to drivers, not signs
    * Also set consistent speeds
    * Roundabouts, raised pedestrian crossing, speed tables, speed bumps (with modifications for buses, police, fire, ambulances), chicanes, narrowing of the traffic lanes
  * Sidewalks and protected bike lanes
  * Painted crosswalks and signals are an accessibility measure, not a safety measure because they do not prevent cars from hitting people. People do not have to slow or stop.
* Communication is key: messages must speak to people, not engineers

### Systematic Safety: Humans are vulnerable and make mistakes

* Speed control and Separation
  * 6 mph - shared spaces
  * 20 mph - bicycles in mixed traffic - chicanes, speed humps, raised intersections
  * 25 mph - drivers yield for pedestrian crossings - narrow lanes, crossing islands, 1 lane per direction to prevent passing
  * 30 mph - 90 degree intersections
  * 40 mph - separate by direction e.g. median
  * 70 mph - freeway
* Functional harmony: avoid incompatible functions e.g. shops and through traffic
  * Local streets 20 mph w/ parking, no lane markings, diverters to limit through traffic
  * Neighborhood principals 25 mph: 1 lane/direction, lots of crossings
  * Urban arterials 30 mph, signalized crossings, bike paths, no shops
  * Regional roads, 45mph no local access
* Predictability and Simplicity: green bike lanes, crossing islands are simpler, turn lanes with dedicated arrows
* Forgiveness and restrictiveness: mistakes do not cause serious injury, prevent mistakes
* State awareness: drunk driving, texting, inexperience

### [Traffic Collisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision)

* Causes
  * Human Factors
  * Road Design
  * Vehicle Design
  * Vehicle Maintenance
  * Other
* Stages
  * Car Collision: car hits object
  * [Human Collision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_impact_(safety)): human hits car (seat belt or steering wheel)
  * Internal Collision: human's organs and tissues hit other internal structures

    * Neighborhood is imporant for livable places, urban mobility, economic development, space/time efficency, pollution reduction, environmental friendliness, cost effectiveness, health, young and old mobility...
    * Neighborhood needs close destinations, network connections, bike/walk spaces, protection, a positive cultural climate, processes, involvement, data, tools.
    * Ground floor is the interaction between people and building - needs shops, restaurants, life - provides safety/security
    * Good things: parklets, benches, walking school bus, snow removal from sidewalk/bike lanes, slow/safe traffic, curb bulb-outs, elevated intersections, traffic island
    * Traffic Calming Areas - no priority for cars, max speed 4-7km/h, no sidewalk - hard for non-sighted orientation - still need a safe place. Similar to shared spaces.
    * Different speeds builds a hierarchy where cars naturally find faster streets - don't make everything slow
    * Traffic Calming goals - equality for all, more safe, less air and noise pollution | methods - shrink the road, disallow through traffic / shift vehicles to other streets, shift people to other modes
    * Marketing and communication

* Public Transportation Integration
* Transportation Demand Management
* High Quality Public Trasnportation
* Land Use Policies
* Car Restrictions

### Moving from Traditional (Car-focused) to Sustainable (People-focused)

* Improve Walk, Bike, Public Transportation, Cars, Planes
  * Long timeline e.g. most Metros have taken 100 years to build, but bus lanes are quicker (cheaper)
  * Must happen before reducing cars
* Demand is influenced by policy, price, etc., not a given
* Design public transportation aroud people, not technology
  * Traditional approach: pick technology, fit city to technology, force people to adopt - results in high-costs and low ridership
  * Successful approach: design around people: network, easy, fast; evaluate options from the city perspective ($$$), decide
    * Mimic the good aspects of cars: e.g. high-speed, high-frequency (12+ vehicles/hr), high-quality e.g. BRT

### [Transport Planning in Delft, Netherlands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5_0T51vOuI) [www.youtube.com]

* Want to increase bike/ped mode share
* Decrease
  * Pollution - Reduce car traffic and speed
  * Noise - Reduce Speed
  * Injuries - High injury network
  * Fire Department - Don't calm these roads
  * Parks - Connect the parks
  * Light Rail > Bus : Predictalbe, faster, more comfortable, etc.
* Road Design - National Standard
  * Highway > 70kph w/ Protected Bike Lane
  * Arterial = 50kph w/ Protected Bike Lane
  * Residential < 30kph w/ Bikes in the Street
  * But not for Delft
    * Not enough space
    * No green space
* New road design
  * Mixed use
  * 10,000 cars/day or more
  * Shops and Houses
  * 40kph design speed, not signed speed
  * => safer, quieter, less pollution
  * smaller lanes, special median (stones), attention markings, raised crossings with pedestrian islands, roundabouts instead of lights

    * Variables
      * Traffic Volume = q = vehicles / hour
        * Max capacity per lane = 1800 vehicles per hour = 1 vehicle every 2 seconds
      * Traffic Density = k = vehicles / km
        * Max density per lane = 150 vehicles per kilometer in congestions = 7 meters per vehicle
      * Average velocity = v = km / hour

        * Momentary = time is constant, space is variable
    * Four-step Model
      * Purpose
        * [Transportation Forcasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_forecasting)
      * Assumptions / Recommendations
        * Zones (and traffic to/from a zone) is consolidated into one point via a connector. Lot of calibration needed here.
        * Create single-use zones. e.g. all residential, all commercial, etc.
        * Use natural and political boundaries if appropriate.
        * Create smaller zones in more dense areas
        * Create a study area bigger than the planning area
        * Does not consider feedback between land use and transportation
        * Does not consider feedback between the four stages.
        * Mode choice is done after destination choice
        * Ignores internal trips and through trips (to/from outside the region)
        * Ignores trip chaining
      * Required Information
        * Links: speeds, capacity (number of lanes), congestion, permissible transport modes, public transport lines
        * Nodes: capacity, turn restrictions, mean delay time for each traffic stream, public transport stops
      * Steps
        * Trip Generation
          * Number of person/vehicle trips entering or leaving a zone.
          * Structural data (population, jobs, square feet of retail space, number of seats, etc.) * Mobility rate for that data
          * Hopefully this is symmetric. e.g. number of people who leave for work = number of people who arrive at work.
        * Trip Distribution
          * Based on a gravity function Tij = Oi × Dj × f(cij)
            * Tij = trips from i to j
            * Oi = trips w/ origin i
            * Dj = trips w/ destination j
            * cij = resistance based on distance, travel time, costs, etc.
            * f() = deterrence function e.g. power function or exponential function
          * Not necessarily symmetric.
          * Big problem is a lack of understanding of spacial decision making. E.g. what if you visit a friend across town?
        * Mode Choice
          * Generalized cost term (utility) = (time + cost + comfort) × perception of each
          * Based on the person (income, car availability, etc.) and the mode (travel time, comfort, etc.)
          * Public transport times from timetable/reality
          * Time includes wait time, access time (walk to car or public tranportation)
          * Comfort includes stress, reliability, safety, etc.
          * Captive riders must use public transportation (no car). Captive drivers must drive (no public tranportation).

        * Route Assignment
          * Car: which roads to take
          * Public transportation: which lines, which transfers
          * Inputs are travel demands (O/D Matrix, mode choice), transportation network with qualities for each mode, and a methodology for route choice and assignment
          * Convert from input (people) to output (vehicles) by dividing by an occupancy rate e.g. 1.1 people/vehicle for commuting
          * Outputs are impacts: traffic, congestion, noise, air pollution, loads on nodes and links
          * Methods
            * All or nothing
              * Route identification for each O/D pair
              * Route choice

                * V = traffic volume on the link

                * Deterministic or Stochastic (Percieved Best Route)
          * Limitations
            * Drivers do not assign themselves logically and change assignments over time
            * Congestion affects destination choice, mode choice, whether to take the trip at all

        * A = arrival time distribution (often stochastic)
        * B = service time distribution (often deterministic)
        * m = number of service points
        * n = number of waiting places before entering the system
        * e.g. One Lane @ Traffic Signal = A/B/1/1; Two Lanes @ Traffic Signal = A/B/1/2; Toll Plaza w/ 3 approaching lanes and 5 gates = A/B/5/3
    * ~ 2 seconds / vehicle to leave the queue
    * [Degree of Saturation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_saturation_(traffic))
      * Deterministic Degree of Saturation = r = Arrival Volume / Capacity e.g. Traffic Signal
        * r > 1 = oversaturated (realistic here)
        * at a traffic signal r = Arrival Rate / (Service Rate * α) where α = Effective Greentime / Cycle Length
      * Stochastic Degree of Saturation = ρ = Arrival Rate / Service Rate e.g. Toll Gate
        * ρ < 1 = undersaturation (realistic here)
        * mean waiting time = 1 / (Service Rate - Arrival Rate)
        * mean queue length = Arrival Rate / (Service Rate - Arrival Rate)
      * Use Stochastic for ρ < 1 and Deterministic for r > 1. Problem at 1.

### [Simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_simulation)

* Model -> Simulation, replace physical systems w/ mathmatical models
* Purpose
  * Study things too expensive, too dangerous, not possible
  * Compare multiple options
* Benefits
  * Less cost, less time, less risk
  * Detailed data about all components
  * Reproducible, modifiable
* Be careful what you define as the system. E.g. if you only consider current drivers, induced demand doesn't exist, but we know it does... In reality, the transportation system is global (or greater)
