## [Road Safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_traffic_safety)

We don't tolerate buildings where people die in accidents, but we do tolerate roads where people die in accidents.

### Measures
* [Traffic Calming 101](https://www.pps.org/reference/livememtraffic/) [www.pps.org]
  * Diagonal Parking
  * Changing [One-Way Streets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_traffic) to Two-Way
  * Widening [Sidewalks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidewalk)/Narrowing [Streets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street) and Traffic [Lanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lane)
  * [Bulbs – Chokers – Neckdowns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curb_extension)
  * [Chicanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicane)
  * [Roundabouts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundabout)
  * Traffic Circles (mini-roundabouts)
  * Raised [Medians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_strip)
  * Tight Corner Curbs
  * Diverters
  * [Road Humps, Speed Tables, and Cushions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_bump)
  * [Rumble Strips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumble_strip) and Other Surface Treatments

### Vulnerable Road Users

* [Pedestrians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedestrian)
  * [Pedestrian safety through vehicle design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedestrian_safety_through_vehicle_design)
* Cyclists
* Motorcyclists
* Children and elderly people

### [Vision Zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_Zero)

* Origin: [September 3, 1967 (Dagen H)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagen_H)
* Philosophy: "No one should be killed or seriously injured within the road traffic system"
  * Ethical approach, not uncontroversial
  * Road engineers share responsibility with road users via the road network
  * The road network must be built to allow people to make mistakes without fatal consequences, because people make mistakes
* The Basics
  * Dense mixed-use neighborhoods
  * Walkability and cycleability
  * Attractive transit
  * Demand Management
* Data Collection
  * Things that get counted count more i.e. pedestrians and bikes are often neglected
  * STRADA
* Inputs
  * Police Data
  * Hospital Data (much better for pedestrians and cyclists)
* Outputs
  * Traffic Crash Reports
  * Prioritization of measures
    * High fatality/injury rate in the area
    * Children: schools, parks
    * Poor speed compliance
    * Wrong speed limit e.g. urban road with freeway speed limit
  * Answers to questions from planners, government, media, people
  * Measure of current situation
  * Measure of effectiveness of specific projects
  * Measure of effectiveness of Vision Zero program overall
* Measures
  * Speed is one of the most important factors
    * Must set the right speed given the area and users
    * Lots of pedestrians and cyclists in the area => lower speed
    * Limited-access divided road => higher speed
    * Road design should communicate the right speed to drivers, not signs
    * Also set consistent speeds
    * Roundabouts, raised pedestrian crossing, speed tables, speed bumps (with modifications for buses, police, fire, ambulances), chicanes, narrowing of the traffic lanes
  * Sidewalks and protected bike lanes
  * Painted crosswalks and signals are an accessibility measure, not a safety measure because they do not prevent cars from hitting people. People do not have to slow or stop.
* Communication is key: messages must speak to people, not engineers

### Systematic Safety: Humans are vulnerable and make mistakes

* Speed control and Separation
  * 6 mph - shared spaces
  * 20 mph - bicycles in mixed traffic - chicanes, speed humps, raised intersections
  * 25 mph - drivers yield for pedestrian crossings - narrow lanes, crossing islands, 1 lane per direction to prevent passing
  * 30 mph - 90 degree intersections
  * 40 mph - separate by direction e.g. median
  * 70 mph - freeway
* Functional harmony: avoid incompatible functions e.g. shops and through traffic
  * Local streets 20 mph w/ parking, no lane markings, diverters to limit through traffic
  * Neighborhood principals 25 mph: 1 lane/direction, lots of crossings
  * Urban arterials 30 mph, signalized crossings, bike paths, no shops
  * Regional roads, 45mph no local access
* Predictability and Simplicity: green bike lanes, crossing islands are simpler, turn lanes with dedicated arrows
* Forgiveness and restrictiveness: mistakes do not cause serious injury, prevent mistakes
* State awareness: drunk driving, texting, inexperience

### [Traffic Collisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision)

* Causes
  * Human Factors
  * Road Design
  * Vehicle Design
  * Vehicle Maintenance
  * Other
* Stages
  * Car Collision: car hits object
  * [Human Collision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_impact_(safety)): human hits car (seat belt or steering wheel)
  * Internal Collision: human's organs and tissues hit other internal structures
