      * measure 1, 5, 10 years after
      * report to taxpayers: accountable, transparent, accessible
      * compare targets/goals to reality
  * Impact Analysis and Evaluation
    * Phases
      * ex ante (before) e.g. cost-benefit analysis
      * post ante (after) e.g. proof of effectiveness, quality control, effiency control
    * Types

      | External | Opportunities | Threats |

      |   | Strengths | Weaknesses |
      | - | --------- | ---------- |
      | Opportunities | take advantage of opportunities | use strengths to avoid threats |
      | Threats | eliminiate weaknesses through opportunities | minimize weaknesses and avoid threats |

  * [Performance Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_measurement)
    * [Key Performance Indicator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_indicator) (KPI)
      * Efficiency: mobility, speed, travel time, travel time variance, delay, queues, stops, level of service,
      * Safety: crashes, fatalities,
      * Environmental: emissions, pollution,
      * Social: accessibility,
    * [SMART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria)
    * Performance-Based Regulation
      * https://cei.org/content/toward-performance-based-transportation-safety-regulation
    * Outcomes-Based Approach
      * We may have accountability - people put money in, they get projects out, they are happy.
      * We do not have transparency - we can't follow the money.
      * Steps
	1. Transparency: Maintain taxpayer confidence
	2. Accountability: Deliver value
	3. Value: best bang for the buck
	4. Resolve conflicts between policies
	5. Get more funding…

* Regional Impact Assessment Procedure
  * balance settlement and nature, accessibility, avoid, shift, improve
  * if and how
  * results in: accepted according to spatial planning documents, can be adopted to spatial planning documents, rejected because of spatial planning documents
* Planning Approval (instead of a Building Permit)
  * Preperation, (Development Freeze), Public Hearing, Comment Period, Approval, Legal Actions
  * legally binding, comments must be addressed
