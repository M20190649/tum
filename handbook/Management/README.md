## Management 
  * Project Project Phases
    1. Planning:
      * Goals: Sustainable Transportation
      * Determine Actions and their effects on Goals
    2. Funding
    3. Programming: multi-modal and multi-jurisdictional, cost/benefit, (See Impact Analysis and Evaluation)
    4. Evaluating (See Impact Analysis and Evaluation)
      * measure 1, 5, 10 years after
      * report to taxpayers: accountable, transparent, accessible
      * compare targets/goals to reality
  * Impact Analysis and Evaluation
    * Phases
      * ex ante (before) e.g. cost-benefit analysis
      * post ante (after) e.g. proof of effectiveness, quality control, effiency control
    * Types
      * Technical assessment e.g. technical, logical, functional
      * Impact analysis e.g. environmental, travel time
      * Socio-economical analysis e.g. safety, environmental
      * Assessment of user acceptance
      * Financial and operational analysis e.g. logical, possible
    * Goals -> Targets -> Sub-targets -> Indicators -> Measurement w/ Units
      * Stakeholders: Customers, Operators, Management, Society
      * Competative, Complementary, Indifferent, Substituable
      * e.g. safety, costs, delays, travel time, size of bike network, reliability of public transportation
    * Methods
      * [Cost-benefit analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost–benefit_analysis)
	* costs and benefits = monetary terms
	  * Direct
	  * Indirect
	  * Intangible
      * Utility analysis
	* uses weights instead of monetary terms
      * Cost-impact analysis
      * Impact analysis
      * Before/after analysis
      * Balancing and Discussion
      * Virginia SMART scale scorecard http://vasmartscale.org

      * [Environmental Impact Assessment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_assessment) (Environmental Impact Report (EIR))
	* [Environmental Impact Statement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_statement)
      * [SWOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWOT_analysis) – Strengths / Weaknesses / Opportunities / Threats

      |   | Helpful | Harmful |
      | - | ------- | ------- |
      | Internal | Strengths | Weaknesses |
      | External | Opportunities | Threats |

      |   | Strengths | Weaknesses |
      | - | --------- | ---------- |
      | Opportunities | take advantage of opportunities | use strengths to avoid threats |
      | Threats | eliminiate weaknesses through opportunities | minimize weaknesses and avoid threats |

  * [Performance Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_measurement)
    * [Key Performance Indicator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_indicator) (KPI)
      * Efficiency: mobility, speed, travel time, travel time variance, delay, queues, stops, level of service,
      * Safety: crashes, fatalities,
      * Environmental: emissions, pollution,
      * Social: accessibility,
    * [SMART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria)
    * Performance-Based Regulation
      * https://cei.org/content/toward-performance-based-transportation-safety-regulation
    * Outcomes-Based Approach
      * We may have accountability - people put money in, they get projects out, they are happy.
      * We do not have transparency - we can't follow the money.
      * Steps
	1. Transparency: Maintain taxpayer confidence
	2. Accountability: Deliver value
	3. Value: best bang for the buck
	4. Resolve conflicts between policies
	5. Get more funding…

## Process
* [Strategic Environmental Assessment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_environmental_assessment)
  * EU: Applies to plans and programs
  * EU: Screaning, Scoping, Baseline, Determine impacts, Public, Decision, Implement, Monitor
* [Feasibility Studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feasibility_study)
* [Environmental Impact Assessment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_assessment)
  * EU: Motive, Scoping, Report, Public
  * DE: Compensatory: Any damage must be compensated. Contingency: Different means, same result.
* Regional Impact Assessment Procedure
  * balance settlement and nature, accessibility, avoid, shift, improve
  * if and how
  * results in: accepted according to spatial planning documents, can be adopted to spatial planning documents, rejected because of spatial planning documents
* Planning Approval (instead of a Building Permit)
  * Preperation, (Development Freeze), Public Hearing, Comment Period, Approval, Legal Actions
  * legally binding, comments must be addressed
  * balances needs vs. concerns, ensures project is in line with goals
* Public Participation
  * Benefits: increased credibility, support, trust
  * Requirements: start early, transparency, continious, active, focus on the decision
  * Direct, Indirect, Institutional
  * Formal, Informal
  * A Ladder of Citizen Participation (Sherry R Arnstein)
    8. Citizen Control
    7. Delegated Power
    6. Partnership
    5. Placation
    4. Consultation
    3. Informing
    2. Therapy
    1. Maniuplation
* Evaluation
  * Why? verify impacts, learn for the future
  * Before/After Studies 
  * Cross-sectional Studies
  * Scientific Studies (Control Group)
  * Impact Evaluation ^^^
  * Cost-Benefit Analysis
  * Multi-Criteria Analysis
  * Meta-analysis
