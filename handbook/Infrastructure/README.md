                    2. Determine design hour traffic volume
                    3. Determine basic capacity of subordinate streams

                    5. Consider influence of mixed lanes
                    6. Assess level of service
                    * Ground Capacity = number of vehicles that can cross superordinate stream in 1 hour. Depends on rank of the stream, type and location of intersection, and volume of superordinate streams
                    * Effective Capacity = number of vehicles that can cross superordinate stream in 1 hour, including effects of queuing. Depends on ground capacity and probability of queues in superordinate streams

		  * Signalized Intersection Design Process
		    1. Find complementary signals: analyze the intersection geometry and determine conflict points (conflicting signals).
		    2. Define which signal belong to which phases and choose an appropriate sequence of phases.
		    3. Determine inter-green times based conflict mode, type, geometry, and speed.
		    4. Determine saturation flow based on number of lanes * adjustment factors
		    5. Determine traffic volumes per stream
		    6. Determine cycle time between 60 and 120 seconds
		    7. Calculate necessary green times including minimum green times.
		    8. Calculate available green time = cycle time - sum of intergreen times
		    9. Determine capacity of the intersection = sum of all capacities = green time for each flow * saturation flow for each flow from 4.
		    10. Determine degree of saturation (highest of all flows) for all movements and assign a quality.
		    11. Set the signal plan.

                    * Requirements for Coordination
                      * Distance between intersections < 750-1000m
                      * Coordinated cycle time across all intersections
                      * Progresssion speed = 0.85 * speed limit to speed limit => offset time
                      * Level of saturation < 0.85 for coordinated stream and < 0.9 for other streams
                      * More than one lane for through traffic
                      * Dedicated left turn lanes
                      * No non-signalized pedestrian crossings
                      * Limited parking
                      * Fixed distance between intersections (for 2-way coordination). Otherwise coordinate 1-way in AM and other way in PM
                    * Procedure
                      1. Define a cyce time for coordination, highest wins
                      2. Calculate signal timing plans for intersections
                      3. Define schedule of green periods based on progression speed and offset. Add 4.5 seconds the beginning of the phase to disolve queues but not more so you don't encourage speeding.
                      4. Assess quality
                        * number of vehicles that do not have to stop / total number of vehicles >= 65% is good
