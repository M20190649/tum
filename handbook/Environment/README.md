### Air Pollution
* Pollutants

  Pollutant | Major Source Engine Type | Source | Effects
  --- | --- | --- | ---
  NOx | 4-stroke, diesel, aircraft | high combustion temperature causes bonding of nitrogen and oxygen | lung function, acid rain, ozone formation
  Carbon Monoxide (CO) | 4-stroke, 2-stroke | incomplete combustion | inhibits the ability of blood to carry oxygen
  Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) / Hydrocarbons (HC) | 4-stroke, 2-stroke | fuel | health, ozone formation
  Particulate Matter (PM) including Soot| diesel, 2-stroke, aircraft | combustion, tires on street | lung function, heart function
  Ozone (O3) | --- | [VOC + O2 + Light => (O2H)] + [NO2 + O2 + Light] | health, plant life
  SO2 | diesel | naturally present in crude oil | lung function, acid rain
  Lead (Pb) | --- | leaded gasoline, battery plants | affects intellectual development of children
  Heavy Metals | --- | --- | ---
  NH3 | --- | --- | ---
  N2O | --- | --- | ---
  CO2 | --- | --- | ---

### Noise Pollution
* Sound
  * Frequency: human hearing 20hz - 17000hz
  * Amplitude: sound pressure (p)
    * hearing threshold: 20 μPa
    * pain threshold: 20,000,000 μPa
* effects: stress, high blood pressure, heart disease, hearing dammage
### Light Pollution
### Land Use (transportation infrastructure uses land)
### Seperation Effects (transportation infrastructure acts as a barrier)
