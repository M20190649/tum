## Travel Behavior Analysis

* Why Travel?
  * Activities at Destination
  * [Recreation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreation)
* Influences
  * Environment: noise, air, water, safety
  * Technology: ITS, phone, GPS, telework, teleconference
  * Space
    * Hagerstrand Diagram
    * cities have more activities within a surrounding area than suburbs
  * Performance, comfort, convenience
  * Available vehicle types: car, car share, bike, bike share, public transportation
  * Cost/price: money and time; perception matters more than actual cost
  * Home/work locations: average travel time ~ 30 minutes each way
* Maslow's Heierarchy of Needs
  * Physiological: breathing, sleeping (food)
  * Saety: security of the body, family, property (work)
  * Love/belonging: friends, family, sex, intamacy (socializing)
  * Esteem: respect
  * Self-actualization: morality, creativity, problem solving (recreation)
* Scheduling
  * Mandatory things
  * Discretionary things
* Travel Budgets
* Mode Choice
  * [Discrete Choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_choice)
    * [Logistic Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression)
    * [Discrete Choice Methods with Simulation](https://eml.berkeley.edu/books/choice2.html) [eml.berkeley.edu]
  * [Red Bus / Blue Bus Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_of_irrelevant_alternatives#Criticism_of_IIA)
* Choice Behavior
  * User Optimum: Maximize Utility/Happiness (McFadden, Litman)
  * System Optimum (Wardrop)
  * Agent-based Model
  * Activity-based Model
* Behaviourally Homogenous Groups: Demographic groups that have the same daily schedule
* We are lacking a good spacial choice model. Why do we live, work, etc. where we do?
* Transportation System
  * Travel Cost
    * Purpose
      * Funding Transportation (current, future)
      * Influencing Travel Behavior (modes, routes, times)
      * Internalizing External Costs (Crashes, Noise, Pollution, Loss of Nature, Division of Urban Structure, Congestion)
    * Schemes
      * tax-based: sales tax, etc.
      * user-based: fuel tax, road tolls, parking charge, public transportation charge
        * internal traffic, origin/destination traffic, through traffic
        * zone-based (congestion charge), link-based (toll road), node-based (parking fee)
        * depends on time of day, congestion level, pollution level, vehicle type, vehicle occupancy, etc.
        * fixed-fee, variable-fee
        * pre-paid, post-paid
      * third-party-based: developer agreement
  * Travel Time
    * Public Transportation: Speed, Frequency, Transfers
    * Car: Speed, Congestion
    * Bicycle: Speed (based on safe routes)
