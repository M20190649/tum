## Travel Behavior Analysis
* Why Travel?
  * Activities at Destination
  * [Recreation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreation)
* Influences
  * Environment: noise, air, water, safety
  * Technology: ITS, phone, GPS, telework, teleconference
  * Space
    * Hagerstrand Diagram
    * cities have more activities within a surrounding area than suburbs
  * Performance, comfort, convenience
  * Available vehicle types: car, car share, bike, bike share, public transportation
  * Cost/price: money and time; perception matters more than actual cost
  * Home/work locations: average travel time ~ 30 minutes each way
* Maslow's Heierarchy of Needs
  1. Physiological: breathing, sleeping (food)
  2. Saety: security of the body, family, property (work)
  3. Love/belonging: friends, family, sex, intamacy (socializing)
  4. Esteem: respect
  5. Self-actualization: morality, creativity, problem solving (recreation)
* Scheduling
  1. Mandatory things
  2. Discretionary things
* Travel Budgets
* Mode Choice
  * [Discrete Choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_choice)
    * [Logistic Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression)
  * [Red Bus / Blue Bus Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_of_irrelevant_alternatives#Criticism_of_IIA)
* Choice Behavior
  * User Optimum: Maximize Utility/Happiness (McFadden, Litman)
  * System Optimum (Wardrop)
  * Agent-based Model
  * Activity-based Model
* Behaviourally Homogenous Groups: Demographic groups that have the same daily schedule
* We are lacking a good spacial choice model. Why do we live, work, etc. where we do?
